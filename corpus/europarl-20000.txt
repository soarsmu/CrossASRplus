commissioner monti has already done groundbreaking work in this area i hope that steps can be taken through the efforts of the luxembourg presidency
i would not on the basis of a rapidly receding and distant year spent at the yale law school give an instant personal view on american constitutional law
mr president i should like to compliment the commission on its proposal and i hope that parliament will not depart from it too much
it is no use our dreaming about these items
furthermore as regional funds covering this area do not include transport infrastructure and the funds available bear no relation to the likely cost of the project they cannot be used to finance the project either
but i will be open to help all those member states all those regions that face problems because there are many possibilities available in the rural development policy
the draft under discussion for the last fifteen years must in our view include the three key elements which mrs ghilardotti has already presented and which were not fully accepted by the council after first reading
it goes without saying that the intention here is to achieve a balanced relationship between flexibility and security on the european labour markets
moreover parliament has improved the commissions proposal by setting out the ways in which the aid given will be annually reviewed and precisely how primary and secondary aid will be monitored and as in previous amendments that i tabled in the house i believe that this will guarantee the prices of potable alcohol as well as an annual minimum distillation volume of fifteen million hectolitres
this may sound very pragmatic but this message only aims to ease the material and spiritual suffering of north korean citizens
how will this fund be managed
the answer is clearly no
we have taken account of this
i will speak very briefly as i would hate to disappoint mr spencer
in addition the criminal code should be made strictly without delay to avoid the occurrence of similar disasters taking human lives in the future
member of the commission madam president the green paper on pensions which we published last summer started a much needed debate on the future of pensions in europe
but i have little doubt that it has been heavily promoted by the large multinationals because it is they that stand to benefit most in my country in britain the vast majority of businesses are small and they provide for some seventy of employment
we all however still have to learn from each other and to strengthen our respect and understanding for each other
his consistent support of the doctrine of the social market economy as the most suitable common socioeconomic model for the community only deserves our thanks and our endorsement of the ideas he has put forward
to extend mobility within the for immigrants with a legal residents permit

on the thirtyfirst of july nineteen ninety seven the mandate of the group of advisers on biotechnology ethics gabe comes to an end for the committee on legal affairs and citizens rights this fact provided us with an opportunity to think about how we wish to proceed further

so the international donors including the european union which is the most important have been obliged to devote a large part of the project funds to recurrent costs and budget support
i can do no other than stress – and in this i am expressing the employment view – how important it is that the social dimension be given greater emphasis in promoting the neighbourhood instrument
the results of the council of ministers of the twentysixth of june two thousand and three however have been insufficient in this regard
is this right or have i misunderstood
therefore the fact that europe pays but is incapable of using political pressure to ensure its objectives are put into practice shows that there is a need for a common foreign policy with common structures this applies not only to human rights but also to other problems and here if you do not mind i will turn to the situation in algeria as another example
the attitude taken by american pilots to cermis hardly bears description they were supposed to be carrying out military exercises but in fact slaughtered defenseless people
of course mrs mcnally we shall certainly be holding this debate with the commission in december but we cannot really blame the commissioners in question for not being able to come back any earlier
the european union has harbored serious concerns at the publication by the zimbabwe government of the new policy relating to the operations of nongovernmental organizations providing humanitarian aid and development aid
producers suppliers and professional users would have to keep records to be made available upon request to third parties such as neighbours other residents or the water industry
therefore we could end up being protective of our biofuel industry and replacing one form of agricultural policy with another one
either our flights are being cancelled or our cars are being taken away and now we are even being denied access to our own parliament
as national cultural components tastes customs life style and social attitudes should not and must not be influenced by tax harmonization
that applies especially to the identification and registration of animals one of the main functions of which is to pave the way for compulsory labeling
we have referred to numerous dimensions and aspects which relate mainly to the management of migration flows at our borders and within the member states
it stimulates egocentricity social exclusion a burning of moral standards and moral decay
thank you for your kind words of appreciation
it is not my intention to deliver an indictment against the commission which is often unjustly and lets face it very conveniently made the scapegoat for distortions within the community for which others must also bear some of the responsibility
we know that the results are a long way off the published objectives
as the honorable member will surely agree this is more difficult for some policies than for others
nor is this a onesizefitsall directive there is scope here for various national choices
thirdly people are generally willing to discount their future and sacrifice current living standards
i want to remind mr prodi and his colleagues who are still here of the findings of the commission s own survey among three thousand european businesses nearly forty of businesses in this survey are still reporting additional costs to render products or services compatible with national specifications
b five hundred and one million three hundred and twenty two thousand and two by mr watson and others on behalf of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party on the observer status of taiwan in the who
you have managed to create the climate required for that essential partnership to take place
mr president ladies and gentlemen relations between the committee on agriculture and rural development and the committee on budgets were always tense during preliminary work on the budget
do we really have to revert to cold sentiments unlike the united states which is offering openings
i am sure that the commission is perfectly aware of these other approaches but they are convinced that the council and the fishing industry do not have the interest or the courage to explore other ideas
that was reason enough for putting off approval of the annual accounts until such time as this matter has been fully investigated
in the light of recent events it is only right and proper that the european union and also the commission should express solidarity
the european parliament usually condemns practices that show complete disregard for the universal fundamental principles of human rights wherever they may occur in commendable unison
many people actually think the automobile sector is the biggest european industry but that is not true the food industry is the biggest one of all in europe
not everything that calls for action in europe calls for action by europe but where europe is required to act europe must be strong
the purpose of the evaluation is of course to improve the future programmes
we must ensure that international conventions are correctly applied as well as cooperation agreements with third countries agreements cannot be made with countries that have not signed the geneva convention
rising to this challenge is a joint necessity for all fifteen member states
i would like to ask the commissioner to insist that in future some kind of cooperation agreement is set up with the government of north korea
you are perhaps not aware of this but extensive animal tests are needed for example in order to be able to verify this sort of claim
in contrast to the protective measures applied to date which mainly related to selective fishing it is now proposed to protect the hitherto unwanted elements of the catch
if the commission itself acknowledges in its introductory statement that the cap reform of nineteen ninety two has not worked to the advantage of less favored regions and producers in respect of arable crops the most significant item of expenditure representing the bulk of direct income support we cannot remain hidebound by the logic of nineteen ninety two
this has affected the sami people in particular
madam president it is quite some time ago that i was rapporteur on the general directive the parent directive if you like on distance selling to consumers financial services were a subject for distance marketing then as well
i understand that the rationale behind this suggestion was not to achieve such an outcome but believe that this would actually restrict patients rights as defined by the court such administrative mechanisms run the risk of being both cumbersome and arbitrary
please do so
in some two years time the next elections to the european parliament will be taking place and the electorate is entitled to know what instruments and means of action the eu will have at its disposal consequently we should like to see the declaration include a common commitment to working on the necessary preconditions for this
these two latter taxes were amalgamated in the nineteen ninety one regulation so once again i agree with the analysis which was shared by mr sánchez garcía
in particular i support the decision to direct a large portion of the e u r nine hundred and eighty million available to the eu for the period twenty million seventy two thousand and thirteen to the creation of new jobs as well as financing the construction in south africa of the necessary infrastructure to provide basic services in terms of health and security
it has been said that europe is sick well the first injection to cure it is an injection of confidence and confidence comes from the transparency and credibility of our institutions
however the events taking place at the moment have sort of dampened the enthusiasm
therefore the shift from a national competence to a european one should not under any circumstances disrupt the proper implementation of the one two hundred or so agreements in force between the member states and third countries
members of parliament are put in prison largescale indiscriminate arrests take place and people are tortured and even murdered in prisons
this concerns the same report that mrs buitenweg touched on
here we are now in twenty ten the strategys objectives are far from achieved and the eu is facing the deepest economic crisis since nineteen thirty three
loading and unloading of bulk carriers
el mr president commissioners the humanitarian crisis in haiti highlights and unfortunately continues to highlight the problems with the european mechanisms for responding to international humanitarian crises
we could consider various changes but i am not going to discuss that subject today
in other words we learn from each other at the moment we are also looking at how additional jobs have been created in the various countries
my view is that any enhanced cooperation must in all circumstances be undertaken within the existing treaties and remain open to all member states
we therefore support this initiative and we advocate that in terms of the european general policy as far as human rights are concerned we should not resort to closing our eyes on the one hand for the sake of a false nor on the other hand be content with mere condemnations or protests
this benefits both the public sector and domestic consumers and we are here to work for the good of our citizens
this has also been stressed by mr färm who said that we need time to adapt our policy
eu regulations must also make it unambiguously clear that exports to other countries must always respect the strictly rules which these countries are entitled to introduce and this in full accordance with the cartagena protocol
what kind of madness is this where is the sense in such a contradiction
i hope then that we will be in a position to see that our common ambitions have been reached
yet those who have this impression overlook or gloss over the fact that this is by no means a normal appointment procedure rather it is a matter of filling a key post that has farreaching powers and the right to conduct administrative investigations into every organization and institution of the union
people are running from lithuania while employers are seeking immigrants from third countries
it is always a great pleasure to receive a question from the honorable member whether it is in this chamber or in another place
as i look at the fathers and mothers of the european constitution in this house i hope that they will also be remembered as gratefully in two hundred time
however we must not hide from the growing disquiet among the public about the systematic bombardment of a european country and its capital and about the growing number of civilian victims our bombs have every day
i have been in contact for the last two years with all the ministers in all the member states i have set up a team of experts which has recorded the difficulties in applying these directives in each member state
the commission has published an invitation to tender with a view to choosing an external consultant who will be able to collect the quantitative and qualitative data relating to the application of this regulation
the european institutions must not shut themselves away in a world of rules and regulations far removed from reality
in addition suggestions of this nature cannot encompass our own criticism and assessment of the state of human rights in the european union for instance
is this not a time to show polish workers and the polish people that the european union actually can do good in this particular situation
the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy has refused this but your rapporteur pointed out that the commission proposal should be reconsidered when the framework legislation on food additives is considered for amendment
the strategy needs to be comprehensive and ambitious it should go beyond financial support and show how africa will invest in people in good governance in growth peace and security
animals will benefit from the fact and it should be to the delight of the many europeans who are concerned about animal welfare
i very much welcome the fact that the commission has indicated a willingness to consider high levels of aid in the next review of the cinema communication
accordingly in the next financial framework a community forest and flood protection programmed should be created with the appropriate funding with a view to encouraging awareness raising activities and fire risk prevention and management
de mr president i understand your economic questions mr rübig and they are very profound in economic terms which i respect
it would not help to develop a genuine single market in consumer credit
we have to develop a territorial approach that suits the specific social conditions of the regions where most roma live and we have to do more to create employment for unskilled or low skilled people
as i see it though the system makes no provision for this whatever
we therefore say that the commission must shortly within two years present us with a report describing how these measures have performed how they have affected the administrative costs of businesses and to what extent they have been useful in combating tax evasion
if the palestinian authority continues to be deprived of any possibility of offering its people the slightest hope for the future and working towards the national palestinian reconciliation that is needed that would be to accept the worst possible scenario

after the servitude of communism the enlargement process contributed to making democracy a reality and to strengthening stability on our continent enlargement improved the standard of living in the new member states and provided a powerful stimulus for the whole european economy as the old member states also benefited from the new export and investment opportunities as well as a larger market
the year two thousand and seven will also mark a turning point in our search for an institutional settlement
in the light of this there is indeed an element of continuity which is also to be found in the motto unity in diversity referred to by mr jonckheer and other members
in essence that is the story
as we have said from the start of the discussions the directive we are debating today is not a third pillar instrument
es mr president commissioner european poultry farming along with other animal production sectors is going through a difficult period
as a first step a wideranging structured dialogue on migration mobility and security will be established with those countries with the aim of securing tangible benefits for them as well as for the eu

mr president i am only sorry that the house is melting away as we come to these important issues but perhaps for the next few moments i will not find myself trapped between these passions as i have been recently
it can clearly be heard here that beneath the budget debate among other things there is a hidden debate on how best to push through the european unions own financial resources and therefore greater autonomy and how to actually move the european union further along the path to federalism
violence affects women at various times of life from childhood to adulthood
this to me indicates a panic reaction and we must not allow our understandable concern with public health and it is proper that we should be concerned to unnecessarily undermine the importance of the common agricultural policy as an essential management support measure for sustainable european agriculture and in particular its importance in keeping the maximum number of farm families on the land of europe and as well in the broader context of rural development to which i know our present commissioner fischler is totally committed
– mr president the world health organisation and the european centre for disease prevention and control have issued extremely serious warnings based on scientific data of a possible influenza pandemic in the future
it is not enough to offer the local language and perhaps english
the designation substances and preparations by no means covers the use of c m r substances in consumer products that is to say in those products with which we as consumers in the first place come into contact and through which we are exposed to these dangerous substances for example when we buy toys textiles new flooring et the directive does not then cover the main source of what we are exposed to that is to say carcinogens and other dangerous substances
i therefore strongly support this proposal which would give hope to the many people whose freedom and dignity is fringed on a daily basis and who do not have all the means to react in the future they might even be able to start a new life in another country
this proposal seems to be a very complicated and not very efficient procedure to me
i am very concerned and unhappy about this answer from the council
nor would i say is it divided in the united states where as we know twothirds of the people oppose this war
the syrian people will not bow to tanks
confidence is also essential because the continuing development of the european model amongst other things depends on what scope for arrangements national and regional administrations will have in the future
there is no such obligation at the moment
this problem is even more acute in the maghreb countries which do not have the necessary technical and financial resources to use water more efficiently
i personally will therefore vote in favour of the report
we are prepared to do everything necessary at the maximum speed possible not indiscriminately of course but if it is clear what projects the funds are to be provided for and how appropriate they are not one of us will be left in the lurch
the present eu moratorium means that while research is taking place the subsequent application of the product is not being allowed in individual countries
this situation is all the more serious as our destiny is increasingly conditioned by the decisions taken by an independent european central bank without there being any government with decisionmaking powers in the economic field over the major areas of choice affecting economic growth european competitiveness and employment
i would also like to make reference to some comments made about imported food let me remind you that as from two thousand and eight we have the regulation on maximum residue levels which is fully applicable
the fact is that we will have a major interest in russian energy supplies only when we are sure that energy will never be used as a political weapon and that the supply will not be cut off on political grounds in other words only when there is an open investment climate in russia
i should like to support you sir leon brittan on one issue and pass on your conviction
people talk about having more time for legislative work we could have this on thursdays and on fridays
mr president in several european languages the verb to congratulate is reflexive
health and safety at work is one issue where eu legislation has a real effect on a persons normal working day
regarding the wise mens group proposal of president sarkozy about which you have asked for my opinion the commission has discussed this issue we are naturally in favour of any initiative that promotes debate and reflection on the future of europe
moreover right from the beginning of its mandate this commission has fought for renewed vigor to be injected into the institutional debate in the union
i believe that we now need to take the debate a step further so that we discuss the question of whether it is efficient enough and so that we also obtain a significantly greater degree of transparency with regard to this
firstly the gypsy minority should be integrated in the short term rather than the medium term there are still no clear measures and we can and should demand them immediately
amendment no five which concerns the budget for the reasons i have just outlined in relation to the programmed as it affects rare diseases as well
i do however wish to specifically reject the proposed increase in funding to e u r four hundred million for which there have been calls on both the left and right of this house
madam president i too would like to thank the rapporteur who has had a tremendous job of work to do
we must however point out some features of the report that are negative and even contradictory one example is the argument for liberalizing trade in line with the patterns that the european union has been following particularly through the economic partnership agreements which the eu has been seeking to impose on african caribbean and pacific countries
in any case regardless of the position that this parliament adopts i ask the commissioner to agree with this proposal by giving a positive opinion to enable an assessment mechanism to be created which after a certain period will enable us to understand what the best proposal is in the light of the facts
the debate has reflected this need to ensure that we bridge the different views and find a workable solution in the end
one thing is certain however things cannot get worse than they have been for the last few decades during which europe and the rest of the world were happy just to sit back watch and enjoy the benefits of the mineral exploitation of guinea

what is being asked of us involves the adaptation of the acquire communautaire
last but not least there is a problem which i notice has just arisen

in writing it madam president ladies and gentlemen i am voting for mrs muscardinis report on a reform of the world trade organisation
we must also reschedule the next i g c

eu and member state activities related to key producer transit and consumer countries must be coordinated more systematically
as early as nineteen ninety eight when the e j n was established a secure telecommunications network was envisaged but it has been impossible so far to agree on the modalities apparently on grounds of cost
precommercial procurement from this perspective can help to bridge the gap between supply and demand in the public services sector
that of the treaty of rome was to ensure peace through a european community uniting yesterdays victors and vanished
i therefore advocate an ambitious blue growth strategy
add to this the fact that he had to do this from his green approach and against that background find a compromise that was not easy
it is quite obvious mrs sauquillo that for my part i am waiting to receive this request one of these days via the official channels in accordance with our rules of procedure if the appropriate authority which in the view of the spanish council of state is the ministry of justice if as i say the ministry of justice sends me a request for the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of the members in question and of other members as well i shall of course refer it immediately to the committee on legal affairs and the internal market after having announced it in parliament
i want the original version with european in between regional and lesserused european languages
mr president madam vice president ladies and gentlemen i would like firstly to congratulate mr papastamkos on his report and thank him for the willingness and cooperation he has demonstrated with a view to maintaining this coherence and the general approach it has taken since the beginning of the doha round
in my view voting for this report means above all endorsing the ambitious approach set out by the tampere european council namely not just the statement that in the longer term community rules should lead to a common asylum procedure and a uniform status for those granted asylum valid throughout the union but also the commitment of that same tampere european council to the full and inclusive interpretation of the geneva convention
substances must not of course be included in such a list on a mere whim
rapporteur f r mr president i would like to say briefly that i hope that we are on the point of adopting by a large majority this european instrument for promoting democracy and human rights because it is the only instrument enabling us to support projects for promoting democracy in third countries without the support of the governments and it is therefore the only instrument that can provide a response to the issues that have just been raised by mr milinkievitch
there is no conflict between the internal market and social security since nothing is as crucial for social security as a job and an income
i hope that it will receive your support
we do not yet have the commissioners proposals
it was a political assassination
rapporteur es mr president i will try to be systematic
regarding the content of the k o k report and how we might carry the lisbon strategy forward i should like to offer three considerations

unfortunately all the assertive efforts undertaken the resolutions and national and international plans for improving the level of protection for women in conflict zones have failed to eliminate this barbaric weapon which is frequently resorted to in modern warfare sexual violence
we do not want these products on the european market at the very least we want them to be labelled because consumers should have freedom of choice
extremism is on the rise on both left and right as the established parties merge with one another and accordingly lack the credibility and the political vision that is acceptable to families in the member states
we have not been treating it as a low priority but i have to say that we are completely on our own in these international conventions
moreover the von wogau report which the european parliament has just voted on supports it in so doing
the level of global food production today is already sufficient to feed everyone

– violence against women comes in many different forms physical or psychological violence rape domestic slavery the sex trade and prostitution et

nor however can we vote in favour of this for it is extremely improbable that this rebuilding plan will work any more than other rebuilding plans in the fisheries policy have worked we believe that the fisheries policy has floundered for in spite of extensive measures and bureaucracy stocks are still threatened
ladies and gentlemen that is the situation as i see it
european citizens must be able to benefit from infrastructure including buildings products appliances and cars among other things processes and energy services offering the best energy efficiency in the world
it is immoral and dangerous for us to encourage the brain drain from developing countries without taking into account the risk of the boomerang effect and without showing any concern for the discrimination taking place whereby the majority of immigrants are offered jobs below their level of qualifications especially women making them all victims of the negative stereotypes and practices in the country of origin and of those in eu member states
unfortunately the seats at euronest will remain empty while there is no freely and correctly elected parliament in the country

madam president ladies and gentlemen i support what mr wohlfart has said on behalf of the council and i should simply like to add that if the european parliament would like to set in motion a mechanism for political dialogue at the parliamentary level the commission would put itself at your disposal because just at the moment anything which can help to open new channels of dialogue with the representatives of the algerian people is interesting
in any case i could not explain here the reasons for the twenty metre ride on the airport bus
they include the need for changes to be explained and for the reasons for them to be stated the importance of maintaining and developing workers skills the importance of complementary and cooperation between the various factors when structuring affects an entire region the particular situation of small and mediumsized enterprises and the practical aspects of managing structuring which include the importance of investigating all possible alternative solutions in order to avoid redundancies

many of you will have been present when the prime minister of the united kingdom made his speech to parliament very early on in the presidency

i feel that what we are seeing is a fanatical regime gradually taking hold in particular in southern iraq in basra to be specific this is a regime in which christians are persecuted alcohol is banned western clothes are banned and veils must be worn and all of this is happening with the complicity of the british troops on the ground
the observations which the committee of independent experts the called committee of wise men made regarding personal lack of responsibility must be taken seriously and there must be an end to all this hiding behind one another backs amongst the authorities in the eu
mr sturdys approach in taking the barbados resolution of the a c p e u joint parliamentary assembly as a starting point endured that this report moved forward from a place of compromise
the text being submitted to you this evening is a balanced compromise that will enable the social dialogue within european businesses to be enhanced and new guarantees to be given to the workers of the twenty seven member states
the truth let me say without wishing to offend anyone is that at the beginning of the iranian revolution and you need only read an article published some time ago in the economist the ayatollahs one of the first measures taken was to ban smoking throughout iran
above all we do not want the annexes to be binding on the member states
i think we need a more determined approach and in that respect i want to conclude by reminding people of the vote in this house on the occasion of the report on the our and the consumer which i had the honour of presenting to parliament a few weeks ago
this also applies to the death penalty

we must recognize the sacrifice that ukraines citizens made in order to live in freedom and be able to decide on their own future
it has been voluntary until now and will become mandatory from now on within the union
i would also like to thank the commissioner for coming here at such a late hour to discuss this issue which is very important for our parliament
the benefit of such a solution is that we do not rule out certain countries in advance but instead encourage them to continue their ambitious efforts to be ready for membership
we therefore do not support the proposal approved today which ignores important aspects of the future agreement between the european union and south africa if these elements are omitted they could compromise the full political and economic effectiveness of this agreement

the first is that a single wholesale market for financial services should be guaranteed the second is the creation of open and safe retail markets and the third is the modernization of the rules of compliance and of the way in which they are monitored

the charter of human rights states that whenever there is a conflict with animal rights human rights take precedence in other words the right to religious practices and not only muslim not only jewish but also christian practices as we have discussed at length in the committee should be protected and protected to the full not least because since we have reciprocal relations with nonmember countries people who practice certain types of religions could otherwise not eat meat in europe because it cannot be produced in europe and cannot be imported

allow me to remind the commission that it has a treaty obligation under article one hundred and ninety seven to answer questions posed by parliament

note is made of the reforms and adjustments to the judicial system in accordance with that which prevails in the european union but exemplary application and incontestable social acceptance are expected in the interpretation of the laws as well as in raising the authority of judges
however as part of this process would you agree council that they must be able to accept legitimate criticism when they fail to live up to the commitments they have signed up to such as the fundamental principles of the olympic charter

when i look at these results and think of the tolerant approach which allows soft drugs to be widely available even for young children i feel that instead of simply clarifying the policy that the netherlands is pursuing we should use this action programmed as an opportunity to think long and hard about which is best the tolerance which is practised in the netherlands or the repressive approach adopted by a number of other member states

a strengthened union must at least make it possible for new countries to join at the end of their journey they should find a house and not a shack awaiting them
however stagnation in the process of democratization was not all that happened last year so it is necessary to be critical where progress was not made or where the situation became worse but also to show that we value the changes for the better for on the one hand the need to strengthen the principles of the rule of law is being neglected and the constitution is based on this law so this should be made a priority

i believe this to be the correct analysis
thirdly the euro mediterranean area

very important commissioner

it should also be demonstrated of course that the aid is really needed
although the proposal from mr rasmussen and his committee concerning transparency and supervision particularly of the excessive debt leverage are right and indispensable we should also acknowledge as very dangerous the opinion of the committee on legal affairs which demands simply that it be left solely to participants in the market to assess the appropriate level of risk to take the committee overlooked the fact that last year the average securities firm was leverage twenty seven to one with no regulation or supervision

should be aware of the need to implement such projects urgently in order to prevent the anticipated collapse of goods transport systems within the union

the root cause of this crisis is an inadequately regulated financial system

lastly the common space of culture and education here we have to work much harder because very little has been achieved so far
if we do not solve the problem of ignalina which is a problem for all of us together then in ten years time we shall have an even greater problem than the one we are confronted with today
p t i regret the fact that some members of this parliament are still proving unable to resist the temptation of using parliament texts in flagrant breach of the eus competences and counter to the principle of subsidiary to encroach on the sphere reserved for member states getting involved in all sorts of issues sometimes rightly sometimes wrongly in the service of plain ideological sectarianism even in matters of the utmost political and social sensitivity

that is something about which i should like to see some clarity
i would like to pick up on what mrs andrikienhas just said about the specific measures that russia has taken we need to ask what effective options we have open to us that will allow us to go on the offensive against those trading partners who have not kept to the agreements made in the g twenty who have introduced protectionist measures who have closed the markets and who have helped to bring about an even greater fall in worldwide economic performance than would otherwise have been the case

if like us the governments decide that the tsunamirelated project takes immediate priority the originallyplanned projects can be taken up in two thousand and six or two thousand and seven under the new financial perspective in some cases the problem is that we cannot go on with the previous project for those regions because the tsunami has affected those regions so we have to give priority to the tsunamirelated projects
mr president after listening to what the previous speaker has to say i ask why cannot we have pride in the television of the public broadcaster and in the television of the private broadcaster that seems to me to be the sort of television that we want

it is a great pity that the committee on budgets takes one forward look at the budget but then encounters budgetary control implications and there is a bit of a gap between the two
we disapprove however of its lack of emphasis on the principle of subsidiary
this report is meant to contribute to doing so
i also understand that there are member states such as yours which is why i have just been listening to you which have not fulfilled their duties and with this in mind i voluntarily proposed a date which has moreover been accepted by the committee on agriculture extending that timelimit slightly but as you know whereas they might pay two pounds an animal in your constituency in mine they only pay one pound
it is a sad state of affairs but it seems that the council has reached deadlock on the entire postal sector dossier
the second question does the new commission endorse the duration of the financial programmes which will commit the next commission and the next european parliament

who are we to talk about the financial interests of the european community
so far he has refused to comment
we are also very insistent in calling for the european parliament to be informed of the substance of the analyses of the crisis situations these countries are facing this is because when the commission grants its loans to countries outside the our zone there is a certain transparency and substance to the information on the behaviour of private banks and on the behaviour of operators which has led to this crisis that the european parliament must be informed of

i wish the european union would interfere and legislate less for if the european union is the answer it must surely have been a very stupid question
i note that some speakers also emphasized that responsibility for coherence in eu policies is not a matter for the council for the commission or for parliament alone
it means recognizing that the european union must urgently adopt additional measures to promote the transfer of technology research capacitybuilding and regional supply mechanisms for the worlds poorest regions it means guaranteeing a specific level of funding with which to develop or construct pharmaceutical production facilities owned by regions within developing countries and increasing overall funding for publicprivate partnerships undertaking research and development in medicines that are particularly important in developing countries
last but not least we should again remind russia to withdraw its called peacekeepers and ammunition from moldova and specifically from transnistria as without this precondition our recommendations to fight corruption organised crime and the illegal export of weapons will remain gestures of our goodwill but will not become a reality

as i have stated in previous explanations of vote the pressure put on the new member states to incorporate the community acquire into their national legislations is unacceptable

unfortunately from the humanitarian point of view this is led by the un and therefore the european union can apply pressure but cannot replace the united nations in that role
as it is formulated at the moment it will allow bad operators to continue to be bad operators
the most acute problems of alcohol consumption relate to young people

i would also like to mention another point in this regard in most political areas we have committees in which representatives of the member states have administrative and supervisory authority but this is used by these representatives at the end of the day to pursue their own interests

however i would ask some questions of principle

the d g a g r i insisted that it knew nothing and that winegrowers were happy
given the situation i have described which will no doubt be repeated tomorrow and the next day i would like a concrete reply from the commission
this is clearly a possibility but we were not in a position to impose it
thirdly it is not enough to ratify conventions they must also be implemented such as the un convention on childrens rights
we will ensure that parliament remains vigilant and i thank the commissioner for pointing out that alongside the provisions in the compromise on which we will be voting the commission wanted to provide information on the implementation of the framework directive on water and if necessary and if any delays build up in the member states or any doubts need to be raised to present complementary measures to ensure that we do indeed achieve environmentally acceptable water in twenty fifteen in line with our vote in two thousand

p l madam president mrs ashton the question has in fact been asked in this discussion today as to why in the european parliament an eu institution we are talking about the n a t o summit the answer is obvious
of course the picture painted by the commission of two strong pillars side by side is a little overoptimistic
what initiatives does the commission intend to take
we must make sure that our words are followed by deeds
i wish i had been wrong in my predictions and take no pleasure in having been proved right
i could just as easily have been born on the other side of the iron curtain in which case i should have enjoyed far fewer opportunities than have been granted me in my life
i would refer here to what we have just heard from the chairman of the e m i on the subject and i would point out to mr garcía that the commission has never said that it would make payments from the structural funds conditional on meeting certain macroeconomic criteria
i hope that the house will not think that we do not give the greatest possible priority to these issues
we are simply surprised that the report does not mention the our once and that it does not reiterate the very serious argument that has been put forward before whereby the our which is soon to become a major international currency would control the dollar by forcing the u s monetary authorities to abandon their policy of benign neglect
however this is not the right time to be considering extending the socrates and youth for europe programmes to include turkey
in a much more general area it is a question of being aware of the fact that humanitarian aid often takes place in complex crisis situations
finally let me comment on the dutch translation of the revised amendment no thirty two in which the words or has a license have been omitted in error
in general terms the common position reflects the position adopted by the commission following parliament s first reading but if we compare the first reading of the european parliament with the common position we see that thirty or so of the amendments made by parliament were not actually accepted
i will conclude madam president by saying that of course all of this must be considered within the framework of what the group of the progressive alliance of socialists and democrats in the european parliament considers to be the basic sociopolitical philosophy in this area
de mr president i would like to draw the houses attention to an occurrence several days ago involving polish border guards and a german cruise ship the adler dania which entered the polish port of swinemünde whereupon three polish customs officers in civilian clothing and without any written authorization sought to confiscate all the vessels stocks of spirits

european unity appeared natural to them
but we have rejected the report as a whole because we believe that the proceedings instituted against austria in relation to the austrian savings accounts are exaggerated and go beyond the actual purpose of combating money laundering
i was delighted that parliament welcomed this plan so warmly
it means as i said in my presentation ensuring that citizens are fully informed about practical information about their rights about the outcome of decisions about the way in which these are taken and about the legal basis
it now requires critical appraisal and monitoring
what practical measures will be taken and what method will be used by the european union and the member states to achieve the objectives of the youth pact taking into account the need for solidarity between the generations

the directive is based on the precautionary principle
better a foreigner in the united states than in europe as someone once put it

in our view no special budget can be created for fines to be paid into if fines are paid they must go into the budget of the european community
how will we explain this deviation to the public

we have no right to impose our view on the i a s c f this is up to the independent trustees but we are making it our submission to improve the governance arrangements i would just point out this basic fact before everybody as we might say in ireland loses the run of themselves in this particular area
the text has not yet been voted on the compromise has not been adopted and yet these people are suffering great economic misery because of us
that will not happen with every country simultaneously
while we were there we promised that we would do our best to adopt a motion of this kind this week i urge the honorable members to support this motion for a resolution

a lack of compliance with these requirements would mean that poor quality information would be obtained from suspect informers

this discussion is particularly important for finding ways of avoiding a repeat of the financial and ultimately economic crisis that hit the whole world in two thousand and eight the collapse of a series of financial institutions cost and is still costing taxpayers dear
at the same council meeting ministers agreed that employment is an important factor for the avoidance of exclusion the link between equality economic growth and employment is very important and consequently the member states were called upon to expand child care and to reduce pay differentials and other genderrelated differences
this should be cause for serious reflection for those who want europe to do more and to do it better
de i would like to take up two points where i also believe that the summits results have rather fallen short of our expectations namely external energy policy and energy security
i am glad to see that we are recognizing the importance of involving pupils themselves in the development and assessment of our educational system
but weaknesses remain without a doubt
the way in which health care systems are run is different is every member state and the funding too varies from premiums to paying for it out of tax money
we consider ourselves to be committed to this process and we welcome the presence here today of that tireless pilgrim of peace ambassador moratinos
that money includes a substantial contribution to help tackle the priorities identified by mr james wolfensohn
thirdly in the area of innovation we will need the european patent which mrs győri referred to under enhanced cooperation and also centres of excellence at universities that are independently assessed

the establishment of a point of contact in the patients home country where the latter can turn for all types of information as well as of an ombudsman for patients and certainly the increase in scale thanks to better cooperation between the member states definitely offer added value to patients in particular to those who are suffering from a rare disease
every month we adopt a large number of resolutions and we often have debates on human rights violations outside the union yet the issue of human rights within the union comes up only once a year

the eu is the leading donor of economic and financial aid in this region
currently all of these areas are significantly underhanded

the events of recent days in istanbul demonstrate the importance of cooperation with turkey especially on security issues

i would like to request two things mr president
the information which the commission compiled via the information network of agricultural accounts and structural surveys should in fact suffice in order to analyse the situation of young farmers and i do not think that we need nor does it make sense to set up a new database especially for young farmers

he will be summoned before the court and if he does not obey this summons he will be arrested if he ever enters the territory of the federal republic of germany again
internet security means not only the use of smart cards and virus protection but also protection from harmful and illegal content
so like the rapporteur and like many others here i consider it essential internationally that social clauses are instituted not just to safeguard the european economy but also to help developing countries to rise up out of their difficult conditions
we should not forget the centres of research excellence particularly in the united states and we should seek as wide a collaboration as we can insofar as the eu can assist in that through the research programmes et we certainly should
i agree with the previous speakers in this respect in particular my colleague
following the beirut damascus declaration which was signed in may of two thousand and six and which appealed for improved relations between lebanon and syria the syrian security forces arrested a dozen or so people for expressing views in this declaration that were different to the those of the syrian government
the commissions estimates showed that a twenty increase in e e could potentially create as many as a million new jobs in europe and an average household can save at least e u r one zero per year
it is primarily a question of removing the differences between the internal market and social policy and creating a single economic and social union
the eu s credibility will be in the balance and in my opinion this is a bad start for the further development of the eu s foreign and security policy
this clearly also means as mr leinen has already mentioned that we urgently need more modules in this regard we can look back to the nineteen seventies and nineteen eighties when all of this had already been worked out
as we have always stressed in connection with chechnya however it is also important to fight the causes of terrorism and in many cases these are poverty and poor economic development
that is indeed the case and it is not open to question
finally i should like to draw the attention of the european parliament and the commission to the habitual delays in consulting the european parliament something which is now part of our history
just as the resolution says i believe that now is the time for the eu to really show the way and to dare to move forwards to leave the reluctant and sluggish united states behind it and together with others to try to ratify the kyoto agreement
in fact we are patting ourselves on the back because the bond auctions in portugal went well last week whereas the reality is that the european central bank was actually using taxpayers money to buy their own debt

in establishing european works councils the solutions more or less made to measure and reached at company level between the management and the special employee negotiating body are granted priority
we said yes to customs union
as greece has not yet provided the necessary justification to demonstrate that such excesses of p m one zero are due to natural events the commission expects to receive plans and programmes in accordance with article eight of the framework directive by the end of two thousand and three these should show how greece intends to achieve the limit values by two thousand and five
of course as i said before we want to further consolidate the energy relationship on the basis of the most important principles which are reciprocity fairness and equality
it regarded the calculations submitted by switzerland as by and large plausible
we shall certainly take action in this regard

the proposal is for a five retention in my opinion ten is far more appropriate and that is why i have tabled an amendment

he described saudi arabia as a country with enormous potential and vast financial resources

mr president justice requires reason and prudence

whether or not globalisation takes place is not determined in brussels or strasbourg

with continued enlargement on the one hand we are taking up an historical challenge that we do not of course want to miss but on the other we must also do what we can so that the identity of our cultures and our peoples is not lost
mr president i am sorry but i cannot say that i agree with this document as it stands or with the contents of the green paper
although some question the importance of open consultation i believe that all stakeholders should have an opportunity to express their opinion
from this point of view we accept the commission proposal in that and this should be made very clear here the genuine political debate will come about when we see what the council makes of the commissions preliminary draft budget
i am not very much in favour of a system of quotas in this field for this risks introducing an element of rigidity in an intervention system based on subsidiary and the initiative of local and regional authorities
so i totally endorse the honorable members reference to the importance of infrastructure investment but i think encouraging more sensible trading relationships between those countries is also absolutely crucial
as far as thursday is concerned
that is great
it is about free movement for people and freedom to live their lives as they wish a free market for people a common market for eu citizens and their families

the commission is aware of the weak points
relations between europe and central america so close in a time of war have become distant in a time of peace
a positive approach will benefit f y r o m which we hope will be helped to join both νατο and the eu if f y r o m refuses to accept the name chosen for it and persists in this refusal it will find that there are obstacles to its accession because it has undermined its own efforts
whatever the outcome i believe that we will be returning again to this issue in the future
i should like to use this opportunity to state my position concerning future enlargements
i therefore support the commission proposal which could be integrated into a european agricultural model
from this perspective i find the numerous references in this text to the features of a state such as country government citizens borders and so on unacceptable
i would like you to give me a specific answer to this question because at the time of the treaty of nice the commission put forward good proposals and good positions which were then ignored by the council
madam president ladies and gentlemen when representatives of the communist serbia of milosevic were here as a delegation seven years ago at the time of the heroic liberating rebellion of slovenia and croatia i had made the following three observations
mr president the commission is doing its utmost to settle proper payment applications within sixty days
nonetheless we disagree with it in essence this agreement is particularly inadequate from the point of view of financial resources
secondly i think that on the european parliament website under the personal profiles retailing the activities of each m e p it would be a good idea to also publish the amendments submitted by each m e p in the parliamentary committees they belong to
at the same time prevention is different to military and civil crisis management in that it is not about reacting to a crisis that has already flared up but about promoting in good time the fundamental values on which we all agree that children should be able to go to school instead of to war and that democracy must be established at all levels
it is not about changing the vat regime i wish the commission could do that
both sides need to play by the rules
it is becoming so easy to make a good living out of crime at the taxpayers expense that when we talk about the level playing field in so many areas of activity involving public subsidies you could say that the level playing field is now crooked
it is a sign of progress that everyone here today acknowledges this it is absolutely imperative however that future regional planning policies incorporate this new information on environmental considerations and sustainable development particularly within the framework of the structural funds and the common agricultural policy
we have to address this issue
the european union has always considered humanitarian policy and the protection of fundamental human rights to be its priorities its vocation which today allows it to play a leading role on the world stage and export beyond its borders the principles of democracy respect for human rights and legality enables us to understand the reasons behind the proposal for a joint resolution aimed at calling on belarus to respect all the efforts that have been made on matters of international law and human rights
these are in large measure the consequences of that policy which is based on persuading agriculture to produce less
anyway i am going to make a point that has an international implication taking my cue from what happened at the recent n a t o summit in madrid during which it was decided to extend that military organization to bring in poland hungary and the czech republic to demonstrate that europe is still lacking a common european security policy
the second point is that in my opinion we need rules based on sustainable development
the amsterdam treaty is to enter into force and will intensify the pressure for reform not just the pressure to enhance the eus ability to act the european elections will be taking place in june
that means that we need instruments to exercise the necessary controls
to be honest i find it astonishing that we now find ourselves having to take an almost defensive line of argument because we cannot consider this issue on the basis of the euratom regulations alone but that we also have to consider consumer protection protection for the population in the event of major accidents in nuclear power plants based on the rules of the european treaty so that we have complete control and a say in the final outcome
the new e i b corporate governance statement provides a useful summary of its policies across a range of corporate governance aspects
i am therefore grateful to the commission for making it crystalclear that the nordea problem which is essentially about the reimbursement of contributions must be resolved by the member states
resistance is growing both on the streets and in the negotiating chambers new players are appearing and claiming a place in the game

i taught law for many years at various universities and this report by the committee for which was rapporteur would not be given particularly high marks by the faculty of law at the university of copenhagen
is it the case that the particular difficulty in getting agreement on the package relates to a very specific part of the package and if so why is it felt necessary to delay the entire package of reform
that is why i proposed challenging member states to remove the barriers imposed on the citizens of other member states and opening up their domestic labour markets

however such a budget will create unfair competition to european union wines and beers this goes against w t o principles
in this context i must criticism the decision motivated largely by political considerations to decommission prematurely the nuclear power plant at jaslovské bohunice although the plant meets operational safety requirements

it would be difficult in the long term to impose a lot of major new tasks upon the commission without also providing the necessary resources in terms of staff and administrative resources

mr president ladies and gentlemen i too must congratulate mr wiersma on his excellent report
the idea is of course to transmit the electricity to europe via high voltage direct current lines from the deserts
this sort of attitude this kind of thinking seems to be insinuating itself into sport and if the european parliament fails to react to it we will actually be failing in our fundamental duty to create a better and fairer society
i wish to make one comment on the studies
for example the community fleet under the spanish flag only has access to eight species out of the twenty two for which there are quotas
the integrated security in europe conference which was held in november gave rise to a debate on strictly control of the sector
for instance if parliaments budget estimates for the year two thousand provide for a sum of e u r thirty eight million just for setting up a supermarket that means that here too as i and the committee on budgets are suggesting we must carry out our control function
i am convinced that regional cooperation should in addition to turkey and russia include the eu member states as equal partners too that is why i have voted in favour of the report
i did it myself as a kid actually

mr president commissioner fischler ladies and gentlemen yesterday we dealt with an urgent motion in relation to energy policy here and we tackled safety issues in the area of nuclear power
while exercising the caution that is always needed in such cases i believe that this is very good news and i am sure that the house will share our satisfaction which makes up for our disgust on other occasions when we have had to speak about the crimes of this organization
the eu has always been mindful of the events of recent months it must make a genuine commitment to proper negotiations with syria with a view to securing the countrys firm desire to conclude the agreement
the task now is to sit down together and clarify what is still possible within the existing treaty provisions

who has not been concerned at the plans of certain private groups to create their own sports competitions outside the jurisdiction of the national and international federations and on the basis of a single criterion namely the size of the participating clubs budgets as we have recently seen in association football and subsequently in basketball too
this was a heavy blow not only against the coptic christians themselves but also against the tolerance which is still widespread in egypt

steps also have to be taken to improve fuel efficiency in the sector
it is important to preserve the rights of member state parliaments and governments to ensure that existing legislation in these areas can be maintained
we must therefore once again call for the abolition of the death penalty as the european union has been doing for a long time
if then we are to talk in terms of more competition we need not only european agencies but also a quality mark for some kind of quality mark has the natural effect of building confidence and enhancing the value in the market
at the moment i see two basic problems associated with this process
the rapporteur intends through his amendments to the commissions proposal to achieve a more complete harmonization of the legislation pertaining to monetary policy

we are well on the way to doing so but we must continue to work at it

i am confident that you will continue to support the just cause of the palestinian people until we gain our freedom and build an independent state in the holy land on the basis of the nineteen sixty seven borders with the state of israel
not because it is not a good idea to ensure that all member states have good laws against incitement but because it is difficult if not impossible to arrive at a definition which could be applied uniformly and which would not lead to thorny problems of interpretation on the one hand there is the important task of devising ways of combating terrorism and saving lives
secondly i feel that following the various reports that the commission could present to us it could be useful for parliament to draw up an owninitiative report on the development of metalworking in the face of what will undoubtedly be at stake in the enlargement process

a clause that states that the unions values are respect for human dignity liberty democracy equality the rule of law and respect for human rights is one that can be clearly understood by all our people and should be sold to them on the basis of those values

mr president i should just like to observe that the leaks do not help the commissions cause to be involved in foreign and security policy decisions
its tries to block the admission of refugees who are in danger and on the contrary we try to help those victims of suppression catastrophes and poverty
firstly democratically elected governments have come together and agreed on a proposal secondly the parliament of the european union has come together and will hopefully agree on these proposals and finally the desire to ensure that accountability – ensuring that the guardians and custodians are watched over by others – is being borne in mind
when limits are set for carcinogenic substances at a given level the daily struggle to comply with those levels in order to protect workers is made all the more difficult

mr president i think that if we delay we are in danger of being faced with an even more distressing and even more difficult situation in a few months time if that is possible given the fate of those whom we are discussing
why do we not make this into a right given that we are already taking the great risk of having thousands of delegated legislative acts

however i repeat this sort of thing has to be done very carefully and cautiously
on behalf of the i n d d e m group s v mr president the european sugar industry is on lifesupport
we should likewise stop fishing for exotic and endangered fish species simply because sushi has become fashionable

this vision of the european founding fathers has today become a reality for the citizens of the european union for millions of students studying at universities outside their country for businessmen linked through trade and investment and for politicians and civil servants who meet on a daily basis to develop joint responses to the challenges of our age
i would underline that at no point in my report is the importance of regional or minority languages disputed i clearly recognize and respect these languages and at no point try to obstruct them
parliament feels that the dutch presidency should set to work immediately on this urgent political issue which we would like to focus on in this debate

the first is the fact that the montreal convention which governs matters globally has not yet been ratified by sufficient countries to give it binding effect nor is this likely to be the situation for some years to come
the use and the protection of the seas must not conflict with one another these two areas are mutually dependent because the oceans can only support us if they are healthy
so turning to france i am sure that everybody shares the commissions concern at the discovery of the first case of the disease on the european mainland
nor am i unaware of the role played by china as a member of the w t o and a future global power
i have no criticism to make of the hard work
it is trying to compensate for the called failure of the market through taxation introducing ego taxes and supporting science and research by means of tax writeoffs which will make the tax system less transparent and require new european legislation
in the foreign policy field we would simply not have the opportunity to adopt a directive in such matters parliament is only consulted and cannot participate in decision
for this reason i will say to you prime minister that we have missed you in the last two years and in recent months during the institutional crisis which ended without a great deal of passion or glory in the mind lisbon treaty
the scientific advice is clear
mr president if today we are to debate the nineteen ninety seven annual report on the eus research and technological development activities then we should also be asking a number of fundamental questions
how will the commission ensure that a decision can be reached in good time on all pending applications for marketing approval
the second element is the provision of legal residence for foreign nationals and from this point of view i do not think that a policy of zero immigration is right for europe
the intermediate solution which we are negotiating with them is a geographical framework with a maximum of three or four levels of sensitivity
i have often said that there is no longer a boundary between external and internal security because all their component elements interact this is the case in respect of both crime and immigration
or put another way the prevailing state of affairs dictates its interests in domination and exploitation and its imperialist ambitions palestine being a glaring example of this
this study was based on a particularly small sample of children who consumed sweeteners

within this political forum which follows on from the zagreb summit in two thousand we intend to renew a political dialogue which will complete the existing framework and will also emphasis the responsibility of the countries of the western balkans in the overall process

the european securities and markets authority esma established on the first of january twenty eleven by the twentyfourth of november twenty ten regulation of the european parliament and of the council is designed to help maintain the stability of the financial system of the european union by safeguarding the integrity transparency efficiency and orderly functioning of financial markets and by strengthening investor protection
we must remember that we already have areas in which services have been liberalism
mr president after a long period of deteriorating political and economic conditions and serious human rights violation in nigeria there now appears to be a window of opportunity albeit a fragile one for a more positive turn of events
we certainly support the rapporteurs view that it is not acceptable for the commission to propose excluding producer organizations wishing to benefit from the improvement plans from eligibility for the specific hazelnut aid we cannot either go along with the commissions intention of reducing community financing from eighty two to seventy five in these extended plans
at the same time in a couple of years out of the total budget for agriculture horticulture and rural development a mere ten will be earmarked for product support
this is a big task which requires a great deal of effort as well as a great deal of money
what is the european subsidy for providing a safe internet for young people
in this house we must end the interinstitutional argument and act collectively with the commission and the council to achieve agreement with checks and balances on data retention the use of biometrics passenger name records schengen information system i i vis police and intelligence cooperation
if we want to redress this imbalance to some extent we really need greater legal certainty in order to guarantee the funding of services of general interest however they may be defined by the member states

i voted in favour of this resolution following the debate with the council and the commission in which we discussed the european unions plans and main strategic objectives for halting the loss of biodiversity on the eve of the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity
if my information is correct it is as follows
the ball is in the court and we hope that the e c o f i n ministers will make it clear to their general affairs and foreign affairs counterparts that a solution must be found come what may
she has done an admirable job
but i also think that this is a call directed at the council rather than a call directed at us notwithstanding what has been submitted to us parliamentarians so far from the preliminary draft budget for evaluation
again this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for prosperity
the commission is demanding that farmers adapt to market signals it would do well today to follow its own advice
it can be cured it can be treated and millions of our fellow citizens can lead full and fulfilled lives if we
mr president i would like to draw attention to the text of paragraph six century in line with the doubts raised by mrs frassoni
we must act cautiously in this case
that means working in colleges schools the voluntary sector across business networks and elsewhere and increasing awareness amongst our population
however in this calculation only half of the increase in applications over the number agreed in nineteen ninety two is taken into account
starting therefore with the questions put by mrs boumediene thiery i will try to reply to the questions of the committee on citizens freedoms and rights justice and home affairs
i agree with the honorable member that administrative reforms are very important in boosting the confidence of the eus citizens
as the european trade union confederation e t u c recently observed in a report it is not more of this inflexible policy that we need
this is something that must be a priority for the eu we cannot allow arms to be sent to countries where they are causing such massive human rights abuses
it believes that too much attention is paid to religious minorities in india and these attacks help it in its attempts to change this situation
the best thing to have happened to the united nations in hindsight is the united states suddenly having become more serious about its delivery capability
this concept will not be grasped by this talking shop simply because if this logic were pursued then euroland would be forced to admit what we have known for many years which is that the eu is bad news for business
instead we should be talking about taking the necessary measures to ensure that the desired date of accession can be achieved
madam president i would like first of all to encourage mr almunia to stick with his original proposal of twenty eighteen
following the recent tragic shooting in finland and the attempted shooting at a school in germany it is clear that we need strictly e u wide standards of gun control

it is therefore up to the cypriots to reach agreement on how turkish cypriots are in practice to obtain certificates of origin issued by the republic of cyprus
india produces a tone of c o two per head of the population as against the member states of the european union with about ten tones on average
for example the aviation sector which is the climate killer par excellence enjoys an exemption from value added tax and duty on fuel
we must of course welcome the policy of structural adjustment aid and the fact that the commission selected priorities here such as education and primary health care seems indicative of a more farreaching policy on development aid than those of other financial institutions
but transparency also means that it must be clear what the member states do with the eu legislation once they have approved it
what do you think the impact of basel i i will be on the forty of companies in europe that do not have any equity capital what will the impact be on tax revenue and what will the effect be on the candidate countries
thus i repeat that my reply includes three basic categories of issues
in view of the dramatic flooding in poland where a significant amount of the country is flooded and people have lost all their possessions i would like on behalf of the european parliament and all of us to convey expressions of support and solidarity with the poles and most sincere expressions of sympathy with those who are suffering today
i would prefer it if members were more active in also dealing with this issue
this general conclusion gives us grounds to view the report as a whole with approval
it would therefore be a good thing to avoid that problem today
it beggars understanding
finally mr president despite that one reservation i would like to express on behalf of my group our support for the graenitz report
but we have not integrated the parliament as strongly as with the newton dunn legal base
i am sure that the members of this house will judge the commission on its overall activities and its actual record as a college
otherwise this debate will go on forever
that amounts to an intrusion into the rights of the individual that goes beyond the rights of any employer
the states that hold these funds are not all friends of europe far from it
the second point i want to make is that the banks were primarily responsible for many of the ills which we are seeing nowadays but what happened a new theory came into being they were too big to fail
it has done nothing
but i think we should both use reason and together take a serious look at each others amendments
this makes it all the more important for us to promote innovation which can counteract these problems by providing creative ideas and solutions
we are very critical of the councils proposal to set up the eurodac database
i roundly welcome this commission proposal implementing the decision of the barcelona european council of march two thousand and two to introduce a european health insurance card
he rules with a ring of steel around him but he is not supported by the people of nigeria they are looking to us for a lead to see in what ways the european union is prepared to put democracy first and its own economic shorter interests second
an example of this is amendment no fourteen which will simplify the monitoring and detection of g m o s
like you we raise the problem of the macroeconomic context
monday to thursday no changes
mr president the commission will continue to encourage the council in all appropriate fora to make progress on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive on common standards and procedures in member states for returning illegally staying third country nationals and to intensify negotiations with the european parliament on this proposal with a view to reaching an agreement by the end of two thousand and seven
the bureau will take the appropriate steps to identify the number of directives rules and so on and have them published
this sends the right signals to markets otherwise major players will have an incentive to simply delay until the time period expires
sponsors are needed but is it necessary to go as far as they went on this occasion by setting aside such a minimal number for people who do not have the necessary contacts
in other words the commissions reform efforts whose aims were linked to assurances concerning responsibility accountability efficiency a new european service culture and transparency have proved a spectacular failure
since being elected to this parliament i have received a flow of complaints from businesspeople originating mainly from the new member states that acceded to the eu after two thousand and four against the activities of local and regional authorities that wilfully impose on these businesspeople additional requirements that are not justified in the least by any eu legal act
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the importance of smalland mediumscale businesses is once again highlights with the discussion of these four reports today
the dublin i i regulation as you will know is part of the european common asylum system and it determines which member state is responsible for the examination and determination of an asylum claim its effect is also linked very much to the sound implementation of other directives such as the reception and the procedures directives
serbia needs to commit to full cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in bringing the remaining war criminals to justice
i am extremely concerned at the increase in human rights violations and homicides for example the case of the twelve yearly urud and his father as well as the new proceedings which have been initiated with the aim of banning the union of education and science workers
it is now up to the american government to secure the adoption of the agreements by congress
i refer in particular to the difficult economic conditions prevailing in various member states of the eu starting with my country and i would make the same comment as my honorable friend mrs matias numerous countries in southern europe and elsewhere are in dire economic straits with the international monetary fund the european central bank and the european commission demanding huge cuts across the board in all state spending more or less wiping out public investment in research
we need to be alert to such situations and to react effectively in cases where a member state violates basic principles that are a criterion for membership of the european union
secondly i have a criticism to make of the spaak report
it has been said that there is no immediate response but changes are being made
the vast amount of knowledge gathered to date correlates poorly with the primary environmental factors influencing the development of a wellbalanced personality
this is a subject that interests me a great deal so i will try to keep it brief
in this context i welcome the recent decision by the turkish parliament to adopt a constitutional reform package to bring turkey further in line with the acquire communautaire
commissioner there are four points i would like to recommend you consider in greater detail in the council debate firstly investment incentives
what a position for any government to put its own ministers in
the attention that this house and other public bodies paid to this matter was instrumental in reaching a solution so i thank you and encourage you all to celebrate the new year of two thousand and four with an appropriate beverage
although some progress has been made too few mandatory requirements are to be imposed on the competent authorities and telecommunications operators as regards the inclusion of disabled people
as has already been said the progress that has been made is clear to see
people in the house wondered if the thousands of victims were not enough they asked how many nuclear accidents would it actually take before there was sufficient evidence
thanks to helpful and kindhearted fellow m e p s in parliament i have obtained a little money from mr cunha and a certain amount of money from mrs jeggle and have thus been able to add a little more for rural development
as far as the d g taxation and customs union is concerned the duty drawback system creates economic distortion as it is actually an export subsidy
as regards cyprus is it possible or in any way acceptable for a european union of twenty five member states to set up negotiations with a country that only recognizes in full twenty four of those member states
in these circumstances does he accept that any impression that the european union is weakening its approach and that impression to some extent has been given by withdrawing the complaint in the w t o will in fact damage our trade will he therefore reaffirm our determination not only to ask for the world trade organization panel to be constituted if required but to take whatever other steps are necessary to prevent the extraterritorial provisions of the helms burton act being exercised in any way against our traders
and i willingly stress and acknowledge that parliament has played a pioneering role here by constantly denouncing gross violations of human rights
de mr president ladies and gentlemen the subject we are discussing today is particularly important because it concerns a special responsibility of the european union
so there is now some confusion as to whether or not parliament adopted the amendment in question by the required majority my feeling is that it did
clearly these issues will be crucial in the immediate future both for greece and for the rest of the eu which is why i voted in favour of this particular report
in some member states the directive will certainly be used as an opportunity to increase competition even though the directive itself does not require this however it does leave the member states a considerable amount of scope
moreover all the member states stipulate a minimum age for the public consumption of alcohol
mr president mr fischbach making europe into one large single market with no internal borders simply from the commercial and economic standpoint is a grave error
they have been on hunger strike since november face a possible death penalty and yet are neglected by european leaders this is in spite of the fact that in early september i warned european governments the commission the u s government and the un secretary general that the regime might be planning the selective repression of ethiopian opposition leaders
can i appeal to the president that especially since
we are looking for something a little more measured
that would be a just and acceptable common policy
it also shows that fishermen and scientists can work together closely and intelligently and come up with proposals for realistic and constructive management measures which allow fishing to take place whilst at the same time managing resources
they were mainly members of the banned organization muslim brotherhood syrian activists arrested in the nineteen eighties and a few hundred lebanese and palestinian citizens arrested in syria and lebanon by the syrian security forces as well as by the syriancontrolled lebanese and palestinian military police
mr president on the question of cooperation with the tribunal i would confirm again that the judgment on whether croatia is cooperating fully in this regard can only be made by the tribunal itself
however we would be doing ourselves no favours if we were to rule out debate on the ground over there and make too fast and too hasty a decision
let us not forget that this agreement is not merely about trade and commerce it bears a highly political significance
i also notice that a number of governments are having discussions in two stages
do we think we can get along like that without seeking a stronger and more united european union voice instead of bobbing the job off onto the few who are willing
author madam president the tropical rainforests in cameroon and the congo are precious and we must welcome this voluntary agreement to address the sustainability of the harvesting of the timber that they contain
at the same time we have to remember that this cooperation is as important for russia as it is for the eu since up to sixty of russian crude oil goes to the eu
i have given just a few examples to show that the council of the fifteen countries of the european union fourteen of which have socialist governments has adopted a totally central to right policy with regard to the economy and development one which is associated with social responsibility in many respects like that of the p p e d e group
a third central element is the relationship between the need for competitiveness and the preoccupation with equality and guaranteeing opportunities to all especially the weakest and the excluded
as a dutchman i have to conclude that there has been no debate or only partial debate on the new agenda for structural funds and so we have to raise the level a few notches
we cannot give a signal from this house that we are not concerned with fundamental economic dynamics in the european union
croatia with a population of forty five million apparently suffers from nearly a million backlogged court cases with a significant number of cases connected to the abuse of property rights media freedom is also under assault
i would therefore urge the commissioner to analyse the possibility of achieving community legislation to harmonies the situation and i believe that we must not restrict ourselves to using an internal political problem to cause difficulties for a european union government
all these efforts can be developed when the g twenty looks closely into the food stocks issue and you can be assured that the european commission will be an active participant in the related deliberations in the coming weeks
otherwise he would have been present in the chamber
mr president we have to face the facts regarding the u s a the i c c and the european union
we need to take a hard look at commission spending on health and ask why such a low percentage of the e d f budget is earmarked for the health sector as mr van den berg has just pointed out that is despite the fact that parliament has asked for one fifth of overall development funds to go to basic healthcare and basic education
i cannot hide the fact that as things currently stand some of your plans will pose serious problems from the w t o s point of view
it might also have resulted in a situation where wealth rather than necessity would have been the decisive factor
the approach is the open method of coordination but measures are needed in a large number of areas not just a few employment is of course important but so are education social security systems and a regional policy which devoted attention to neglected areas
he was referring to the many declarations made at previous summits which were not binding in fact a whole series of worthwhile practical initiatives were decided on in luxembourg and that is why we do not thankfully need to start from scratch
member of the commission madam president i wish to thank the honorable members for this rich debate which has shown the houses constructive support of the process of the european union integration of serbia
subject administrative affairs and the lisbon treaty
mr president thank you for giving me this opportunity to explain how i voted
we believe that through this tiny enrichment of the treaty it will be possible to adapt common policies so that effective support can be given to the strategic sectors of these regions such as transport energy telecommunications without charming any of the other vital forms of support which are already being given
in its white paper on the development of citizenship therefore the commission should provide for all appropriate measures to improve the conditions for exercising these rights and to guarantee that they become fully effective outside of the union too
thus what is missing is an idea of what the future of europe will be and therefore nobody is thinking of who we will need to call upon over the next ten or fifteen years to lead our highlevel factories or facilities
finally the institutional framework is vital
even today an austrian has far better chances in the labour market if he speaks an eastern european language no matter which one yet as a consequence of a misguided education policy this skill has hitherto not been encouraged in my schools

the other absolutely crucial point i would mention is directly connected with the subject of the current motion for a resolution the political weakness of the our system

in its first ten years of existence the european internal market has chalked up some considerable successes not least the creation of twenty five million new jobs
mr president mr presidentin office of the council ladies and gentlemen the apparently inevitable choice in this house as indeed in the united nations is between war with or without the backing of the security council and the weak yet appealing position of those who are asking for more time for the inspections those in favour of the latter alternative are relying it must be said on the anglo american military pressure on saddams regime and are in fact making the inspections an end in themselves although they are well aware that hans blix and his men are unlikely to be able to get saddam to disarm by themselves

the billingham report is a positive sensible response to the commissions communication on services of general interest in europe an issue which has been neglected at the community level for far too long

however what we need to say to european citizens today is that we are responding to the credit crunch and shall be injecting money into the real economy
we must bear in mind that in effect this system is covered by the nineteen ninety three e u r o r e p proposal but it has made hardly any progress
i therefore support an improvement in terms of the issue of interpreting

that will obviously ease the problems in two thousand and three
this is not about going beyond the terms of the treaty as mr barroso has already so rightly said but it is about keeping to the spirit of the treaty of lisbon with regard to the additional powers for parliament ensuring that the council does not turn back the clock and gathering to the arrangement on how we work together and how we come to an agreement between parliament and the council

try as one might to pretend that there is only one the fact of the matter is that there are two points of view to be found in the international community the first of which tends to be held by the european union and the second by the united states

m s mckenna the services of our chamber are quite familiar with us members and also with the collaborators who are authorized to enter the chamber they recognize each and every one of them very well

we do not believe that three months is acceptable
the target as has already been stated is to reduce these costs by twenty five by the year twenty twelve
mr president i congratulate all four rapporteurs who have worked long and hard on their dossiers
do you though not think it a matter of trustful cooperation or proper administrative procedure that you should at least inform the rapporteur when a report completing the evaluation of a particular stage of an action programmed is coming out

p t mr president insecurity in the sahel region requires development effort as commissioner piebalgs said a few days ago
i think this is an excellent suggestion that we should accept promptly and in a constructive spirit
it is clear to everyone that in order to achieve the objectives of the common transport policy high quality public transport which provides a real alternative to dependence on private cars is absolutely vital and it is equally obvious that improvements in the efficiency of public transport and the transparency of public transport finances are therefore in the economic social and environmental interests of the community as a whole
the important point here is that the new member states should achieve equal involvement in all dimensions of the policies as well as full and equal rights and that they should be treated equally
mr gasayev fled to spain where he sought asylum in two thousand and five his application was turned down on the basis of a confidential report drawn up by the spanish authorities to which neither he nor his lawyer had access

these practices are not safe from blunders and mean that each additional our of the european budget is susceptible to becoming a source of concern for the committee on budgetary control

the future of europe
mr president ladies and gentlemen i would like to begin my contribution to this joint debate on structural and cohesion policy with thanks to my colleagues particularly to the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs most especially to mr hutchinson our own shadow rapporteur on the hatzidakis report who is prevented from being here today – something that he very much regrets – by the fact that he is acting as an election observer in burundi
of the seventy eight million citizens who live at risk of poverty nineteen million are children
the financial perspective which the european council agreed on last year in berlin strictly distinguishes between the commitments for the fifteen member states and the additional funding earmarked for the candidate countries therefore there is at present no possibility whatsoever of funds earmarked for the fifteen eu states being appropriated as expenditure for future member states the candidate countries that is

the explanation was really very difficult and the six founding countries said that this is our neighbor we must take into account that we have not been able to build or maintain adequate relations with this great country and that we do not want to leave it with a siege feeling a kind of permanent siege
is that one of the reasons why we are having to wait longer to get these positive lists of feed materials and the general hygiene rules which follow from the reforms we so enthusiastically greeted last year
so it is a gradual process but a clearer and faster process than that planned by the council
there is another point i should like to raise the legal basis
what matters in fact is the area of analysis
today i wish to clarify my position on the most important points without going into details of the undertakings i have already given and provide you with the additional steps i am ready to take
we have a letter from commissioner patten – you can ask mr garriga polledo – saying that progress is on its way and therefore putting money in the reserve has actually been to some real purpose in that field
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on thursday the eighteenth of december two thousand and three

there is no reason to continue imposing fines on producers for producing large quantities of milk
happily the polls indicate a yes majority the irish have realized that in this particularly difficult international environment the fact that they belong to the european union and to the our area has protected them from greater trouble
the european institutions those of us who are politically active at a european level also have to provide care for english consumers as well as make provision for them even if national provision is an overriding priority it should also be a matter of concern for us

incidentally everything was approved unanimously in the committee on legal affairs and citizens rights
el mr president honorable members i would like first of all to thank the european parliament for the special attention paid to this strategy
i also hope and trust that they will begin to appreciate and to continue to drink milk
it even specifies the legal basis for each legislative initiative and that too makes a great deal of difference and you provide explanations of them which makes the whole thing so much more manageable why though are the existing legal acts the ones to be continued in two thousand and seven not listed alongside them
this will be the last budgetary report of this parliamentary term and my last parliamentary report
allow me today to open a debate on a new proposal not on a high commissioner but on a whole new issue
at institutional level the body of european regulators the famous b e r e c offers the opportunity for the twenty seven national regulators to contribute to the functioning of the single market in a more transparent and effective manner the strengthened oversight of remedies by the commission supported by b e r e c will consolidate the single market by improving the consistency and the quality of implementation of the framework across europe and ensure that operators have a level playing field
first human rights and then of course the reference to turkey
it could be a step in the right direction if the european union turned this into a policy of defending people in the knowledge that accountability is required for one king kong is more than enough
so in view of the urgency of the situation both in environmental terms and with regard to the increasing scarcity in the medium and long term of renewable energy sources we need to envisage steps that encourage the participation of public and private operators engaged in this essential and vital sector
m h p is the only open interoperable standard which meets the requirements which need to be imposed on this system
i welcome the participation of two women in the interim government and i am hopeful that the new generation of younger progressive and modern political leaders will see the way to establish a new order based on equality of the sexes and on full political and social rights enchained in their international treaty obligations and cease to regard women and their role as a purely economic one and a procreative one and banish them to invisibility in their burkas
the image of the eu in the world the transatlantic relationship the fight against terrorism and freedom of movement within the schengen area all mean that the request to receive prisoners from guantánamo merits a collective and consistent european response
regulation is now a key asset in globalisation as we are seeing

in accounting terms this position may have a basis in practice however farmers do a very difficult job with many imponderables dependent on thousands of external dangers not only weather conditions and natural disasters as has been mentioned here today but also decisions taken by technocrats at a european level
i am referring in particular to recent declarations made by the moroccan government which suggest that it intends to increase unilaterally from two to four months the biological moratorium included in the current fisheries agreement which if carried out would be exclusively applicable to community boats in other words portuguese and spanish boats just like the declared intention not to renew an agreement which if i remember right was established little more than one year ago
nevertheless and you are right in this regard it is clear that in recent months some worrying trends have unfortunately developed with regard in particular to religious freedom and to freedom of expression these trends are illustrated more specifically by the harassment of the catholic community in hanoi and by the sentencing last week of journalists for their investigation into corruption
granted you have perfected the stability pact which means yet more sanctions that will not work unless you boost the economy
some suspicion continues to linger in the minds and hearts of the people
the credibility is at stake here the deadlock needs to be broken
the commission also made a decisive contribution to this success for the conclusions are significantly similar to the contents of the preliminary synthesis document which we drew up in preparation for the council
the various political groupings in this house may not fully agree on how exactly to do this or how far to go in this regard but we are in reasonable agreement on the broad lines

today this house must get it clearly across to the council that china turkey burma and east timor are part of the list of priorities
protests in the background
because state television was able to report round the clock evoking a profound sense of shock at the unimaginable suffering of the people in the stricken areas
mrs graenitz has a completely different approach a consumerfriendly approach which is quite admirable but she has not dealt properly with the question of the extent to which harmonization for the purpose of securing the single market is perhaps not always such a good method for bringing about the highest possible food standards
i would like to approach the question of the exploitation of technology from the viewpoint of the individual also

in congratulations the rapporteur on his excellent work we can but hope that the commission will duly take into consideration the proposals parliament has put forward in accordance with the commitments made under the code of conduct on the implementation of structural policies and that it will confirm with fitting amendments the transformation of this community initiative from a mere instrument for internal redistribution to an opportunity to boost and enhance relations with neighboring countries
agriculture is subject to the vagaries of climate
so that is quite some way off the shutdown date we had mind

i want to discuss how we can build from a world which today looks unsustainable unsafe and unequal a truly global society which is sustainable for all secure for all and fair to all
f r madam president i shall speak for just two minutes if i may since there is no debate or oral explanation of vote which i find rather astonishing in this kind of procedure

the next item is the debate on the report a five hundred and two million six hundred and ninety two thousand and one by mr andria on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs on the establishment of a facility providing mediumterm financial assistance for member states balances of payments
as the objective of the regulation was to deal with fixed wing services i do not believe that it was meant to cover such niche operations
cities are also important and integral parts of transport networks since they are the transport nodes where different forms of transport come together
real energy alternatives are needed to combat this

this was the game that crucified christ
we the european parliament are more than willing to play our part in this exercise as you know
the big compromise will under no circumstances bring the eu closer to its citizens which is of course what we normally strive to do
i would simply say that as far as i am concerned since taking up my duties i have obviously noted the fact that the council asked judge bruguière to go and carry out this factfinding mission in the united states
what is even more regrettable is that europe seems to lack the determination to resolve them
conditions of fair international commerce with fair competition have therefore been damaged while within the w t o on agricultural procedures for example the united states continually accuses europe of undermining healthy international competition by granting aid income support export subsidies and certain production subsidies
in this regard nanotechnologies represent a huge opportunity
i believe that the european unions strategy must counter the growing prospect of chaos and violence through strengthening the military presence and making it more effective as well as through stepping up the efforts for reconstruction development and democratization in afghanistan increased development assistance in afghanistan basically means an investment in our own security
there is also a need to strengthen the use of all domestic energy sources from conservation by increasing the proportion of renewable sources to greater use of safe nuclear energy
the second possibility is that we tag along as competitors and that is what we shall do if we launch ourselves into an arms race or suddenly embark upon an attempt to match the united statess military capacity
it is important that there is an agreement and i am confident that it will be adopted tomorrow
but this does not justify failure to act or lack of initiative at union level
i do believe though that it is important for our students who go abroad that the necessary recognition of academic achievements and degrees should be pushed through and improved and that erasmus students should have study abroad improved and made easier for them

without european intervention to prevent abusive and abnormal concentration of power it will not be possible to build an information society where citizenship rights the sense of belonging and the widespread demand for knowledge and culture find effective incisive and genuine responses and are not cynically sacrificed on the altar of an entirely apparent quantitative and ephemeral growth ultimately empty and impoverishing
as to location i have no view except to say that this will be a modern network system in which researchers and communities will be working independently they will not be concentrated in the capital city which is chosen as the institutes headquarters
so in the coming weeks our strategy must be to clarify the political conditions for renewing the talks and prepare the ground for movement short of new offers
be that as it may what i would like to dwell on at this moment are some more specific issues
the first sentence should be changed to read
most say it is about time
it is unfair that our immediate neighbours should be made to bear these negative consequences alone under the pretext of the omnipotence of the internal market
the working members of the committee on the rules of procedure are to be congratulated too for demonstrating the will for positive cooperation throughout
the european union has already benefited from these opportunities
these doubts should come as no surprise they were expressed at every council meeting between nineteen ninety five and nineteen ninety eight
mr rübig please listen this is important
that was how it was
they suffer an agonizing death
in my view commissioner an excellent and positive reform of the structural funds has been concluded with projects aimed at concentration and simplification and with an effective partnership as a result of the contribution of regional and local authorities which may lead to increased efficiency in the actual implementation of the structural funds
the third theme is legal immigration which i see as an opportunity and certainly not a danger
this programmed was indeed discussed in the commission but it was not notified to parliament
as i said we will have the information from the report on final beneficiaries so we will know what is being done for the roma or for other minorities
is that not in turn the background for an almost paranoid racist idea of sixty million turks sitting on packed suitcases
with this directive the exploited pay more than the exploiters
i am afraid the principles involved are far too important for that the committee on the environment public health and consumer protection in consultation with the committee on agriculture and rural development needs time to consider the matter
i would like now to say a few words on the issue of vertical restraints
mr president i have a question for you about the tobin tax
during that time settlements have been built and the signing of the oslo peace accord has brought the two sides closer together
so there is a very large market to be satisfied
georgia is part of europe
opportunities for adult education and training are becoming more and more vital with aging populations and increased demands at work
i can nevertheless reassure my fellow m e p s for a large number of member states are convinced that these services must remain in the public sector
however as predicted the council has changed the legal base to articles ninety three and ninety four
secondly i think that we must also ask ourselves if we can use the amendment of article one hundred and thirty six in order to strengthen the economic governance package which is currently under discussion mrs wortmann kool and other rapporteurs have tabled six proposals
therefore i am sure we will have more opportunities to discuss this issue
given that we have witnessed the unprecedented development of computer software over the past decade or so do we now really need to introduce detailed rules to regulate it
enforcement of intellectual property rights criminal measures vote
they have to demand that their ministers not all ministers are like mr de rossa will work within the intergovernmental conference to deliver two things that we really need to do our job at european level

the specifications also provide guarantees against counterfeiting in particular in the case of the higher denomination coins
on behalf of the u e n group mr president the report on the table today demonstrates once again the relentless attack on member states that operate low and successful corporate tax regimes
i also commend his conversion to a longstanding conservative policy that of wideranging reform of the eu reform which is essential now that the eu has ceased to command the respect or to engage the enthusiasm of the public
this is a fine aim a good aim
those in favour of the regulation also point the finger at the pharmaceutical industry but in this case as being opposed to the proposal because it wants to see even higher volumes of sales
there is john ashcroft the u s attorney general his senatorial election campaign in missouri was partly funded by monsanto a g m o multinational
that is to get under way during this french presidency
fi mr president china has increased its pressure on the tibetan government in exile

european politics military and civilian action must be coordinated effectively
all must exercise restraint and be committed to peaceful means and peaceful means only
i feel that this revision of the directive on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms respects this balance because on the one hand it does not impose restrictions on research or experiments and on the other it lays down clearer and more restrictive rules on the release of g m o s into the environment thereby protecting consumers and biodiversity
and it is very cynical to portray the european financing of european election campaigns and all manner of european political foundations as a strengthening of european democracy
for all these purposes allocations of funds made to objective two or other regions must have the same level of community financing as objective one regions thus avoiding imbalances in treatment that would be unjustified in the case of damage caused by agencies outside the actual areas affected

we believe that we should support the i l o which as you know is currently trying to apply a series of mechanisms
meanwhile the forthcoming palestinian parliamentary elections present the european institutions with a serious and urgent problem in the shape of participation by hamas the islamic organization that features on the terror list with good reason
the public sector will not take care of tourist development in its entirety through the aid it supplies through ourselves and through the impetus it provides in particular for the creation of major infrastructure the public sector can however help tourism develop further

the next item is the debate on the report a five hundred and three million six hundred and twenty two thousand and three by mr cashman on behalf of the committee on citizens freedoms and rights justice and home affairs on the adoption of measures concerning the repatriation of mortal remains twenty million thirty two thousand and thirty two i n i
this is why our group although it has taken an active part in establishing the committee of inquiry and in its work has eluded the conclusions of the latter presenting a minority position
this is a unique situation until now no european agency has ever failed to be granted discharge
unfortunately the eus legislative framework on media pluralism and media concentration is still inadequate
thank you very much mr busquin
the reason is clear we believe that parliament is an organ for controlling management never for participating in management for that we have the commission the council and a whole range of organizations

the commission accepts many of the proposals
there are certain responses europe must make firstly it must activate the solidarity fund we spoke to vice president tajani about this just hours after the tragic events

in writing i would like to congratulate m s bauer for her hard work in contributing vital recommendations to the european commission on the application of the equal pay principle the pay gap has a major impact on the status of women in economic and social life and constitutes an obstacle to equal economic independence

at programmed level it is proposed to reduce the number of programmes in the area of education and training by putting erasmus leonardo da vinci comenius and grundtvig under the same umbrella an integrated lifelong learning programmed
we have devoted a great deal of attention to this matter not only in the chamber but in our committee on petitions too
we have to let the normal process of law go on
i support the report on precarious women workers because i cannot conceive that in the twentyfirst century major differences persist in relation to women in the european union with regard to employment opportunities quality of work income and equal pay for equal work or work of equal value
normally speaking protests are directed at big desire for profit or at a government that considers itself to be fighting
it should be noted however that this report even though it supplements the measures that have already been presented with regard to immigration for the purposes of employment and family reunification does not take the same approach
we can also expect employment to receive impetus from more flexible ways of organizing work such as contract work and wartime jobs from which women benefit in harmonising work and family
from the answers at yesterday s meeting of the committee on budgetary control there was no evidence of any change to the so far secretive attitude of the commission and its administration

i refer here to some wish to implement competition rules for clearing and settlement service providers
finally i would like to thank everyone for the kind words on the swedish presidency
indeed why legislate without having upstream criteria or downstream operational implementation instruments
as members of the european parliament we should rejoice in having played a part in this process and commit ourselves to ensuring its success
we are involved in trying to support it not least administratively as it tries to develop free trade agreements in the region
there is no consistency in reality
one might say that mr gallaghers absence from the house and my own presence here are both due to our each having become ministers that is the way it is sometimes
i do believe that we will make progress however
it will be examined in the light of the legal opinion i would emphasis again however that for the council the main thing is the content

it is therefore high time we sprung into action to save the european eel and a broad and comprehensive approach is desperately needed for that reason i would also thank commissioner borg for the swiftness with which he has translated owninitiative report into a proposal for a regulation
but that cannot be guaranteed because we have to unite fifteen member states behind a common stance
we m e p s now have a chance to show that we are determined and serious in our commitment on these issues
mr president the report on agricultural products from the overseas territories does not appear on occasion to take into account the rules of globalisation and free trade which are moreover advocated by the european union
european tourism can acquire greater visibility coordinated advertising identity in its products and its objectives and can become visible and distinguished both in the rest of the world and to european citizens

bearing in mind that the current crisis had its origins in a statement by a health minister in the united kingdom albeit with no consultation or information going to the commission or the european community beforehand can the commissioner tell us whether there have been any discussions between the commission and health ministers in the member states on the transmissibility of b s e to human beings
and anybody who imagines that i have been putting forward socialist principles in the socialist group for the last two or three years has clearly not listened closely to the nuances of my position
in that light the committee of experts which issues implementing decisions of this framework legislation should not simply be given to make any proposals without any opposition
this will be particularly important in future

instructions have been given to the commissions financial control and antifraud services to fraudproof all draft decisions and legislation

mr president i want to thank the rapporteur for having fought like a lioness for access to environmental information
we are promoting the humanisation of criminal law in the member states and the quality of european criminal law

in my capacity as chairman of the committee on economic and monetary affairs i wish to express my thanks to mr bolkestein for the fact that our negotiations on governance laborious and difficult though they were nonetheless succeeded in getting this formulation incorporated into the white paper as a commission proposal

it deals with improving the exchange of information and avoiding overlapping between various activities for cooperation
it is sufficient for the ethical issues to be regulated on the basis of subsidiary the regulation almost exclusively applied to products that are ethically uncontentious and must enter into force if the protection of european patients and their safety are to be guaranteed

mr president representatives of the commission and the council the volume of world trade has soared in recent decades
as such well face these challenges steadfastly and responsibly
my final point is that in all of this we need to have regard to the area of public broadcasting and broadcasting which is free to air nothing in this directive should force broadcasters into encryption and into measures of protection not necessary in terms of the purposes which they serve

we can see that if there is no genuine and peaceful development in the mediterranean region it is to all our streets that the fire spreads the attack carried out on djerba which was aimed at tourists shows us how close the flames have already got to our front doors
however at the same time i think that the reforms to member states healthcare systems are of paramount importance in this instance i believe that the european commission ought to be involved more regarding these reforms to the healthcare systems
however there are still some obstacles to the development of logistics
you would like to know the netherlands point of view as a member state of the european union
this is not satisfactory
i would like us to be positive and place the pressure where it needs to be

applause we must pursue a direct and multifaceted dialogue with the asian countries and must turn our eyes to africa that unhappy but so frequently courageous continent to that africa where on closer inspection we see alongside regrettable and untoward events arising here and there new young democratic capable and generous leaders who deserve our trust

female unemployment is lowest in the states that provide proper care for women during pregnancy at birth and whilst they are feeding and later bringing up their children

century i will mrs schroedter although very reluctantly because the european commission really has no say in what any political party in malta does or does not do

tourism as the rapporteur rightly states in his report is not only a factor of economic growth it also makes a substantial contribution to democracy and political equilibrium in developing countries
it is therefore a fantasy to believe that in this context there will be money to pay for the enormous cost of natura two thousand
however i must make two essential points
i think that if we do not succeed in reducing the gap between the single currency and the two other great issues namely the fight against unemployment and the political progress of the intergovernmental conference that if let us not deceive ourselves the conference ends up with a minimum result that if we do not progress sufficiently towards political integration the success of the single currency itself may be compromised
well i am aware that there are problems with the legal basis and i know that the council is making a forceful case for having only the consultation procedure apply when the list is drawn up

nor is it a measure that tries to be ambitious or reviews the whole issue of asylum procedures as such or indeed asylum criteria

in short contrary to what the committee on foreign affairs purports the mission is not really taking over from n a t o
i realize that it was hard to tell when the belgian government was acting in its capacity of president of the european union and when it was simply acting as a member state but i would like to know what really happened and why all these measures were adopted despite being condemned by various speakers as breaching the rights of citizens who were demonstrating peacefully in belgium during the last summit
the criticism that we are adopting here is not directed against peoples or states it is directed against the intellectual deficiency of those who propagate such ideologies no matter where they are in europe
a religious minister who recently entered the government said that all the palestinians should be thrown into the sea and that those who stayed there would be like the turks in germany or the algerians in france

the lack of funding for decommissioning measures will delay this process which would pose a threat to the environment and human health
sudan has ratified the united nations convention on the rights of the child and accordingly committed itself to retraining from executing any persons under eighteen years old

the union is obliged to protect biodiversity and conserve species by defending animal welfare and taking action against cruelty in whaling
it was mentioned only once in the resolution because the resolution concentrated specifically on the information network security measures
finally i would like to thank the shadow rapporteur the rapporteurs from the other committees and everyone else who has otherwise contributed to this report
this kind of negotiation is unpleasant for all involved i believe that the main reason why this happens is that the current funding model has been exhausted

increasingly rapid localization will steadily reinforce economic political and cultural dependencies but at the same time there will be a move towards regional cooperation and integration particularly on the african continent

the european parliament also plays an essential role in the formulation implementation monitoring and evaluation of youth strategy

firstly article ninety eight of the rome statute on the international criminal court cannot be used as the u s a proposes

all the member states have said they are aware of the need to restructured the industry
over the past couple of weeks at the outset of the hungarian presidency a great many critical words have been said about the hungarians and very often these words have been unfounded and unjustified
nor does the failure to condemn those people who carry out the most vile acts in this europe which we are trying to build day by day the europe of freedom security and justice
mr president the title of the report the role of the union in the world is nothing if not grandiose
since we want to make savings i propose other things such as polishing the friday subsistence allowance for our colleagues and the subsistence allowances for journalists too

at the moment that aid is not getting through in the way that it should

mr president on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists i should like to agree with the comments made by my fellow m e p s
the absence of such measures is particularly regrettable
because those that produce unsafe toys know full well that those toys can and eventually perhaps will kill a child
this is in line with assuming responsibility for global development
the commission will then produce a statement on the financial framework after nineteen ninety nine which takes account of the possible enlargement
i hope that this remains the case
i would therefore request that you also consider extending an invitation to ecumenical patriarch bartholomaios as part of this year of intercultural dialogue
commissioner as the rapporteur emphasises our experience of the previous fisheries agreement with greenland was extremely disappointing with much lower percentages of catches than the quotas that were initially established
it is a difficult pill to swallow that having blatantly disregarded international management of the mackerel stock and in twenty ten declared a catch of one hundred zero tones iceland has the freedom to export its entire mackerel catch into the eu
this is the information i have
es mr president at the request of the finnish delegation account has been taken of oil tankers in areas of ice formation in the baltic
i secured agreement on a text consisting of two sentences to be added to article one hundred and thirty six of the treaty

thirdly anybody who nationalisms rather than europeanises is throwing sand in peoples eyes
having said that i do acknowledge the objections raised and comments made by many members on the issue of decisionmaking processes on the need for new decisionmaking processes
here too therefore i do not see what else we could do
phasing out national currencies and introducing a single new european currency is not an easy task there are over two hundred and ninety million people who live within the twelve new our zone countries alone
furthermore i believe that this lack of transparency is prejudicial to the companies which most respect the safety rules and since that respect is not known and the greater quality of the most serious companies is not known it offers opportunities to those which are less serious
i think that the recently passed directive or amended directive on company councils constitutes one of the eus major contributions in this matter
parliament has a need and a right to know the answers to these precise questions
we need to better coordinate the provision of aid abandon the redundant formalities and strengthen control in order to be able to respond to the everchanging situation
i shall conclude by making two points
i shall cite three examples
this places us in a position where we can have dialogue with these countries tackling the question of a euro mediterranean citizenship where human rights issues are not a question of us interfering in their affairs but of the common need to establish values which are at the basis of the kind of peaceful coexistence we want

i have previously asked about the alleged involvement of the european own intelligence resources in the management of slush funds in offshore accounts and i still await a reply
what i learned from this conference was that it is possible to reach the same objective without resorting to inflammatory language and for that reason the group of the european peoples party christian democrats and european democrats has not used the term agricultural reform outing instead for an expression that although rather more unwieldy has found its way into the joint resolution simply in order to avoid provoking counterreactions that would then get us no nearer our objective
that is why i proposed random checking and fingerprinting at border crossings

action against burma is well overdue
womens experience and skill remain insufficiently used in environmental policy actions
this will ensure that the stability of the markets will not be threatened
in the same way the commissioners private offices must have a supranational structure as i have maintained for years
this objection concerns in particular amendments nos one five six seven eight nine and thirteen also a considerable period of time would be required to set up appropriate new administrative and indeed monitoring mechanisms in time to be effective and this would create difficulties that would make it impossible to ensure that the resources were shared out in good time
if we were to link together projects across the different departments we would be able to achieve much more for the rural areas such as decentralised energy infrastructures broadband cabling over a much larger area and crossborder water infrastructures
we must appear united if we want to pursue common goals and he was right to point this out
but we shall have a decision very soon
here we now have aggressive action on the part of the israeli government we have barbarous foolish and dangerous acts and from that standpoint i think those acts should be condemned by the european union the united states and by every international agency
we do not have them under control because our approach is a strongly centralist one
as well as being the result of communal efforts these proposals are also based upon a thorough impact assessment which has confirmed the technical and financial feasibility of the proposals

time is short but recent developments both on the island and in ankara have created a window of opportunity and i hope that you mr presidentin office will work with all parties to craft a compromise

any dissonant noises are treachery and have to be silenced
initially there was a complete ban now closing is allowed on a therapeutic basis but not for reproductive purposes
the problem is that we have to contend with multinational companies as you said europe has to take the lead in corporate social responsibility but it also has to take the lead as regards the conduct of european companies located outside europe

it is absolutely true that one of the initial flashpoints of this balkan crisis was kosovo the repression of kosovo and the abolition of vojvodinas autonomy originated the crisis in former yugoslavia

nevertheless we are very concerned about the situation in kosovo everything is going in the wrong direction there at present
then there is the continuity of the service its quality and the specific results the transparency of its administration and its receptiveness to consultation with users
mr president i would like to return to a matter which i am recorded as having raised in yesterdays minutes
however as previous speakers have said the declaration does not contain any convincing references to the social state what some people somewhat sheepishly call the social model sustainable development viable development autonomy and hence if i may put it thus a viable union profile
how did we restructured
the report expresses the eu philosophy of producing foodstuffs in order to increase the profits of the food industry not to meet the peoples food requirements
what we want is to make it clear that the status quo is no longer an option today that europe has serious competitiveness problems when compared to other regions of the world and that we intend to put this right by adapting and renewing our social model
they are vulnerable to threats which no longer respect national borders as a result of their interconnection with and interdependency on other infrastructures and the inability to guarantee their security and resilience based on purely national approaches
once more world food security has been in the spotlight however the time for discussion is over now it is time to deliver
when i protested and demanded the release of some c w i colleagues the police themselves told me that it was preventive arrest preventive detention
you even have three minutes time enough to score an equalize i think
incidentally this is banned in america
having said that certain amendments approved by the committee on civil liberties and internal affairs seem to be characterized by views which are somewhat unrealistic even demagogic which far from promoting the situation of thirdcountry nationals would risk causing rejection by the people of the host nations
the oligarchs in both countries have been involved in this and what is the role of these presidents in generating huge sums of hidden profit
it broadly agrees both with the commissions analysis of the situation and with its conclusions
no we cannot do this
the final decision to grant or refuse development consent must take into consideration the results of consultations and the information gathered and must contain the main reasons on which it is based
so do not send your waste to dounreay under any belief that it is going to be safely disposed of
however the management of the programmed and cooperation with the iraqi government in implementing it is not effective
there used to be an american play called same time next year
giving substance to the new approach means giving the ors the means to become genuine partners for europe and that is where we need a fresh perspective to envisage a today partnership from which everyone will benefit
that would be completely counterproductive
de mr president mrs boumediene thiery s report addresses the problems that the commission mentions in its report on how matters stand with regard to the application of provisions on residence rights
there is however one area where we do have considerable scope for improving the lives of senior citizens in very practical ways and i am thinking here of how we can use the machinery of european cooperation to ensure mutual recognition of acquired social rights such as sickness pay and pensions
however the dumping that goes on today between our various countries helps destabilise markets and i believe that europe should tackle this issue
this is obviously very important
we should therefore start to consider seriously the demand for every industrial or mining activity to be licensed only when the resulting waste will be immediately and completely destroyed or neutralized as part of the manufacturing or production cycle
does it require detailed voluminous risk assessments before work is carried out a height no it does not it is a very easily understood readable implementable directive and it should be described in that way
i would like to wish the presidency every success in its work on implementing one europe
without them financing and other mechanisms are of no use
madam president i think it is pretty rich to compare the european arrest warrant with a party statute however there are of course parties particularly in germany where there is a close link between arrest warrants and their party statute
i would like to pose a more philosophical question if the law were to be widened in such a way that it enabled the bugging of both ministers and presidents as happened in lithuania and if this somehow endured a greater war on corruption crime and the abuse of power would you still believe that such a path is risky and that we need to think more about citizens rights
it would be a pity if the p p e d e stood by its initial choices which instead of resulting in the exploitation of the competitiveness of quality which is the advantage of the european economy insist on more and more exploitation of cheap labour
i believe the greatest contribution we can and must make is to stand by our convictions and be prepared to take on the costs and the responsibility

in the interests of making this process easier the commission has accordingly pushed ahead with a programmed for training thirdcountry crew members and for recognition on the part of member states of qualifications issued by third countries
this includes a package of measures aimed at intensifying and structuring the contexts with dissidents and civil society as well as with the cuban authorities
in my view our main priority at present is not ratification of the lisbon treaty
the heads of government have the choice they can either recognize the rights of parliament and its projects or they can humiliate parliament in which case there will be no budget

indeed they are by their nature more accessible for small and mediumsized enterprises than traditional large commercial contracts
furthermore interoperability is important for genuine simplification of administration
i am not talking about negotiations with russia on belarus as this would only imply that russia has some sort of special rights to this country
i took very careful note of commissioner fischler s remarks perhaps the most practical suggestions we have heard to date
at modane the destination of the first people leaving via the fréjus pass of the eighty two kurds welcomed with such ceremony forty have vanished into thin air
despite the simplifications we must guard against the risks of spoiling them or reducing their effectiveness in this context what is surprising in the commission proposal is the lack of detail in the scope of the measure and the fact that the commission is relying on the accounting network to evaluate it
then we will have to make cuts in places which is perhaps not the right way to do it
it is going increasingly mobile and recent threat analysis suggests that organised crime is getting increasingly involved in criminal activities in cyberspace
i am impressed with the way in which the p p e seems to have moved from its rather negative position in the environment committee debate into accepting some of the principal amendments which we think are important
we should ask ourselves a very straightforward question namely whether afghanistan would not export terrorism to the rest of the world to an even greater extent than it does now if we did not provide it with financial aid
right from the start the our was a completely misjudged construct that was bound to fail it is not possible to shoehorn together states with completely different national economies under a single shared currency
i believe that in a country as oilrich as nigeria equal access to resources and income redistribution are necessary for the peaceful resolution of these conflicts
mr duff as regards the need to ratify the treaty as you understand i fully share that priority and i think precisely that the social and cultural dimension of europe should be highlights i am doing my best in this matter trying to explain that in europe we need a strong internal market but europe is more than a market and i think you can agree that this is also a shared commitment
i believe that at the very least european consumers must be able to recognize in future whether the products they are buying come from a particular country where basic principles do not apply
and if due attention is being paid to the risks of transporting these substances by road another terrestrial mode of transport the same should be done with maritime transport

latvia has satisfied the conditions for membership of the european union i am not the one who should be applauded today for this success
in other words risks caused by the selfemployed worker which they are not protected from

the fusion reactor iter could also play a role in this respect for it is in research into fusion and plasma that nanotechnology presents a whole new challenge as a means of advancing energy efficiency minimizing losses due to wear and tear and of developing strategies for fighting against corrosion not least in the generation of energy
but unfortunately it took quite considerable time for anything to be done on that
unfortunately it is not only germany
my gratitude to them is no less heartfelt
mr barroso your political guidelines provide little illumination as to your plans and drag out much of the same rhetoric used five years ago
assessing the exceptional character of any disaster is left to the discretion of the commission which hitherto has only regarded it as applying to damage caused by hurricanes
human rights are it is true the most appropriate basis for the worship of a particularly obnoxious vice called hypocrisy unfortunately the report we are debating here today has a grave historical tradition behind it since as long ago as one thousand seven hundred and ninety three robespierre had a particularly demagogic declaration on human rights approved by the convention and accompanied it with a brand of state terrorism known as the terror
we will also be organizing a conference on commerce in rural areas during the first few months of nineteen ninety eight and this conference will take place with the cooperation of the committee on regional policy

because the question has been asked i shall also just touch on the fact that the fixed subsidy rates do not favour the export of live animals
in fact article forty nine of the treaty on european union does not apply in this case it provides for the accession procedure for european states it does not cover other countries

and finally commissioner protection against cover attacks and terrorist attacks has to be established in all sectoral policies of the european union where crossborder emission of hazardous materials may occur

respect for human rights international law and democracy is after all one of the fundamental requirements and basic conditions of the european union
i do not see any point in the amendments which mr lannoye is tabling
i am less impressed by some of the points in the commission s proposal for example concerning the distribution of costs between the eu and the member states at present seventy per cent for the eu and thirty per cent for the member states
what i do not see is any concern expressed for those in financial services or for the customers they serve
secondly are the presidency and lady ashton aware of how much the views of again sensible people about the charade that passes off as the quartet is prevalent amongst a number of people what actions are we going to take to ensure that the cost of this operation is matched by its effectiveness which presently is nil
we support all your endeavours that bring this opinion into the basic principles of the budget
moreover i welcome the fact that amendments nos three four and seven were rejected by rollcall vote
mr president yesterday i gave an explanation of vote in writing on trafficking in human beings and there is no record of it in the minutes
as you indicated berisha is exploiting the situation in kosovo to the hilt in order to destabilise the situation in albania too
it would not be a bad thing for example if we set up a special office in the area based in cyprus to take account of all the irritations and take the corresponding initiatives
madam president it is nice to see the commissioner here in parliament we look forward to seeing her in scotland again soon and to continuing our very fruitful cooperation on this policy
the third is that she cannot really think that anything at all relevant could be said by people who parade here through this assembly in fascist uniforms
women continue to fare worse than men on the european labour market
it is essential for future policy in this area that a holistic and balanced approach is taken
it is now our mutual task to represent the nations of europe here so that they too can have a say in the affairs of the european union
as europeans we cannot behave like schoolmasters in a conflict in southeast asia
secondly the money gained from the criminal acts is so great that it cannot be used up unobtrusively by private individuals
if there is no obligation to report knowledge of actual crime in this respect in member states we hope that the commission will encourage the implementation of such legislation
i should like to advocate that a great deal of attention be paid to the interconnection of route plans at international level therefore
we must show political judgment and responsibility in order to understand what we can ask of the new commission and in order to await and support the reform process proposed by president prodi
thirdly it is a country that suffered a lot during the twentieth century and as a result of a rather questionable intervention this i say quite openly by western powers is currently in a situation in which it has a president who many people there do not feel to be their own

the european parliament donates a great deal of money to africa we send it billions of our on top of which we now have to provide humanitarian aid
mr president ladies and gentlemen in july i announced to you my intention to build a partnership for europe – a partnership for prosperity solidarity and security

b five hundred and two million three hundred and fifty two thousand and two mr corbett and mr van den berg on behalf of the p s e group on the refugee crisis in vietnam and cambodia
moreover the commission has not considered lithuanias proposal to reduce the quota until twenty ten taking into account not only whether a member state voluntarily reduces its production quota but also whether it has bought a supplementary production quota
does this mean that everything is smelling of roses or that nothing is going wrong

the twenty twenty strategy presents significant and ambitious challenges for europe in five areas that are seen as strategic i employment i i innovation and research i climate change and energy i v education and v combating poverty
it is important to remember that hazardous goods are also transported by rail which could have devastating consequences in the event of an accident
we are now in a situation in which the software producers and a large part of the information society may be affected by this matter in the future

underutilisation on this scale seriously undermine the entire administrative process with regard to the eu budget
as you can see there is much for us to do in contending with the trafficking in human beings and we have to be aware that these tragedies are being played out on our doorsteps
for example a week ago the commission opened an antidumping investigation in connection with certain types of chinese and indian shoes
the regulation also sets up an information mechanism to keep all member states informed of actual or potential obstacles and action being taken against them
however the agreement arrived at with senegal obviously undermine to some extent the development objective of poverty alleviation because the agreement gives the eu fleet and others i presume access to demersal species and to pelagic species which are the principal source of protein not only for senegalese people but also for those peoples of africa who live in landlocked countries
may i once again sincerely thank the european parliament for its excellent levels of cooperation in the negotiations on the framework research programmed
i think that is all that need be said
no what we need most of all is more efficient spending
if you are able to offer a budget line with a great amount of additional money please do but i do not see that happening
that is why our group advocates close cooperation with the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe and also if need be the setting of a temporary committee to help defend human rights and human dignity

the mechanism of the market if left to itself would meet the needs of supply and demand at competitive prices
we swedish conservatives believe that through production and trade we can not only put an end to poverty but also improve our environment

they dispute the preferential regime granted to the poor people of africa the caribbean or the pacific and in so doing they are calling into question the policies of the european union and even the european union itself which might possibly be the least negative aspect of this whole affair

ro mr president i welcome the civil movements in tunisia and egypt that have successfully toppled two dictatorial regimes which had become entrenched over several decades

i would now like to address the british presidency with all due respect friendship and frankness
per capita g d p is not sufficient on its own
our request is made for reasons of legislative technique a somewhat mysterious term meaning that in our opinion postponing the vote for a few weeks could help our institution to negotiate an outcome that is positive or at least more positive than the situation that would arise if we were to vote on this draft tomorrow
earlier today mrs oomen ruijten delivered a report on this aspect
i would also add that when we talk of the possibility of introducing tests for example in the event of dispute between the commission and member states or in the event of dispute between the commission and third countries carrying out tests can also help to decide if a country belongs in risk category i i i or i i i if for example certain statistics cannot be organised differently
it has been a very comprehensive hearing procedure and the aim is to give a new impetus through community arrangements
the european union is showing through an initiative of this kind the importance it attaches to a new balanced world governance

thank you very much mr sturdy but your comments do not refer to the minutes
in conditions offering anonymity and without any controls the upshot of this is disclaimed responsibility when it comes to choosing and using linguistic terms these terms are often infiltrated by slang cynicism and even vulgarity
this is a commitment from the eu to avoid policy choices that undermine its salutary work in the field of development cooperation and indeed to pursue actions across the policy spectrum that will benefit developing countries
for once we can express our support for the initiative of the international community which through the ambassadors of nineteen countries in nairobi strongly condemned the tragic events and demanded that a process of democratic reforms be launched
p t given the rocking fuel prices and bearing in mind their devastating effects on people and business transport fisheries agriculture and industry it cannot be forgotten that the big oil companies have seen a massive increase in their profits basically as a result of the practice of price speculation which is based on the speculative valuation of cheaply acquired oil stocks

this is a good example of how we can do that effectively

the difference is that in december nineteen ninety five we could have thrashed things out around the table and now all we can do is make a protest on paper this will of course not stop me from approving the paper protest because it may after all still make a small contribution to letting turkey our neighbor country and n a t o partner know that the best possible neighbours can only remain so if first of all the turkish occupation troops leave cyprus and certainly if the turkish threat of war because that is what it is ceases

to my chagrin the dutch parliament in particular has been guilty of this type of behaviour even as recently as this week
the convention pursues these objectives by establishing a set of international minimum standards for the fishing sector that in certain areas are within the exclusive competence of the community
is the commission aware of this situation and how will it take it into account when it assesses the czech application for protection of designation of origin
a second point which is also quite important is that we have to take into account the crisis that we are experiencing in such a context of crisis we must take this opportunity to convert and retrain the labour market so as to avoid negative social impacts
i would like to take this opportunity to point out that the community has no effective redemptive policy for forestry protection

the only question i have about the giansily report is paragraph five which talks about important products without any cost to the european budget or disruption to european markets
i believe that in terms of applying cuts the efforts of the council are quite sufficient since it is a great specialist in that area
mr president first of all i would like to congratulate the rapporteur for her report
in its initial phase it was administered by a small foundation based in brussels with both the european parliament and the commission playing an active role in the allocation and supervision of projects
on behalf of the u e n group ga mr president the leaders of the european union signed the reform treaty on the european union last december this treaty will ensure that the european union will operate more effectively in the years to come
i am not necessarily convinced that this is the most appropriate way of tackling the problem
we will move on to the other rapporteurs and if he arrives in time we will give him the floor

your active involvement in this forum over the last four years has indeed promoted european values and i can only thank you as members of parliament for this as well as for the excellent cooperation between our institutions

i had always thought that the problems of banking secrecy letterbox companies and tax havens were confined to luxembourg austria and the swiss cantons z u g and s c h w y z but it now emerges that thousands of billions of property was kept in the netherlands with the help of one hundred and eighty one trust offices five private companies and one foundation the favorable investment climate for foreign companies created by the dutch government in the nineteen nineties gives swindlers and tax evades elbowroom
in this connection the proclamation of independence is quite a normal process besides it was made calmly serenely and unemotionally and with full respect for the ahtisaari plan in the countrys parliament
prime minister i welcome your speech today it offers the promise to our continental colleagues of a less perfidious albion
as the rapporteurs statement was not correct i think this constitutes a point of order
one of the problems is that it is very difficult to find concrete reliable data on the impact of untying
as both mr cunningham and mr perry have quite rightly said we must not underestimate the economic damage that will come from this decision
thus i am very glad that this text was agreed at first reading since urgent progress must be made in this field

in the immediate future the committee should arrange a visit to thessaloniki thus the director and officials could reassure us as to the future of c e d e f o p its viability and that it can play a useful role in research into training and retraining
it follows then that in addition to the principle of for we also have to consider the idea of for
i should point out that it is particularly painful to those of us who have long argued in favour of the usefulness and validity of an interinstitutional agreement providing credibility and stability for the unions financial framework

there is the issue of subsidiary but subsidiary does not mean doing
establishing specific centralized systems such as for the approval of active substances benefits everybody it means that experiments including animal experiments are not duplicated approval procedures can be more easily guaranteed and arguments and suspicions between member states can be avoided
we really would be welladvised therefore to approach the matter with some measure of humility we can offer our services but we should be careful not to adopt a didactic approach all the time
secondly now that p t o m s have failed the commission is working on an alternative base to deliver reconstruction to the north and east
and i would remind you that it was the commission which introduced the export ban in march
the proposal to delay accession that has been made by the very same people who were in favour of turkey this morning is something with which i have difficulty and i actually find it extremely arrogant

and therefore as long as fascist brutality goes on trying to silence those who have been democratically elected we will tirelessly go on denouncing it again and again
at the same time let me draw your attention to the commissions report on the functioning of the transitional arrangements for the enlargement of the first of may two thousand and four and in particular to the finding that the arrival of workers from the accession member states has had a beneficial effect and actually helped to reduce imbalances in national labour markets without the newcomers largely taking the place of local jobseekers

please do not be scared that by not granting discharge you will cause this commission to fall
the drivers must have a goal to aim for they must know where the finishing post lies

de madam president mrs győri mrs reding i fail to see the point of this debate
i am really pleased with the savings we have managed to make even though they have come about as a result of our efforts to conserve our resources
as a result of the conferences held and the activities we have been involved in regarding the enforced prostitution of women a network has been formed through which women can cooperate
this will increase even more due to the absence of an depth reform of the cap which we recommend and due to the undeniably restrictive content of the rules which will govern some of the cohesionrelated instruments
at the same time it confirms the sound choice made at the beginning of the nineteen nineties in countries such as poland where the reconstruction of capital markets was based on european standards which is now amplifying the harmonization of regulations across the european union
i also appeal from this chamber to the football authorities in romania to reverse this decision and allow politehnica timişoara to remain in topflight romanian and european football

however it is an idea which has already been taken up by the horizontal measures in agenda two thousand
this technical report is not going to solve all the problems but it is a simple first step in the right direction
and now i will give some of the reasons why we cannot accept the other amendments
we also know that the united states are currently waging a campaign in russia against the kyoto protocol
mr president we have to face facts footand mouth disease which we thought we had confined to great britain has now reached continental europe

but i do not believe as you indicated that better regulation or the longer solution to what mr von wogau was dealing with in the lamfalussy proposals can be left to the convention
i am sure commissioner verheugen that you will explain this as a misunderstanding or a misinterpretation and quite rightly point out that this represents a breach of the confidentiality you presumably agreed on
lastly we support the idea of retaining the sevenyear financial framework given that even in this area the tendency is to downward
in the current quest to replace mr santers team with another and for the distribution of interests and responsibilities to take place unless these two conditions are met control and the creation of independence releasing this commission from the grip of interests we will have the same outcomes
we really are not up to it

our strong belief in free trade is perfectly compatible with the need to ask for a level playing field
firstly there was overwhelming support among stakeholders for the application of the principles
unfortunately however both the commission and the council simply welcomed the report as an important contribution and did nothing about it
my pleasure
i think it is excellent and well thought out in particular when he says we should make ourselves more visible through centralized decisionmaking processes by increasing our presence with a clearer figurehead with a large effective staff and a wide remit to coordinate and take decisions
we should commit to this off our own bat
the result has been a very complete and significant agenda for the coming years
the health check simply provides an opportunity to streamline and simplify the common agricultural policy in line with the two thousand and three cap reform
then the debate on the separation of powers will be a completely different debate from what we sometimes hear now
i should also like my remark to be noted in the minutes
i am sure that the czech presidency the first council presidency by a former warsaw pact country will set about this issue with a particular sense of its responsibility and will in collaboration with its french and swedish colleagues bring this matter to a successful conclusion
it is about channelling our precious resources for research into producing weapons that are going to cause conflict in other parts of the world
the eu needs common legislation enforced uniformly in all member states for combating tax fraud and evasion
council you have the chance to get us out of this ridiculous situation and thereby enhance the union in the eyes of its citizens

the committee on budgets also shared our concern about the use of the allocated part of the money in the cohesion area for additional funding of other projects such as the european institute of technology on the strength of a decision by the council that would be at odds with the principle of cohesion and would also deplete the european parliaments prerogatives
i have one further point to mention that is also very important to me public procurement must not result in the institutions selected losing their democratic rights

will a majority of eight votes suffice or will a different majority be needed
we must not forget however that in the interests of protecting the environment and limiting climate change we will ultimately have to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases that is we need to limit our use of fossil fuels rather than try to find alternatives for storing the emissions underground
in the letter of understanding that the commission forwarded to parliament and in its communication on cohesion policy and the environment the commission has listed a great many measures in relation to which as the latest discussions with the committee on the environment public health and consumer protection have shown we have definitely made some progress although this can only be recorded in future reports

the european parliament resolution only skims the surface of the problem and tries to deal with it within liberalist parameters
recommends that there should be twenty five different collective agreements one for each country
as i said the commission does not have the facility to make this sort of intervention
i can see the attraction in an integrated approach but i share views who said that the situation is similar to what we have seen in the case of policies on issues for years anyone who did not wish to give any consideration to issues said that there was no need to do so because of gender mainstreaming everybody then waited for progressive policies on issues and equal opportunities to miraculously appear
it is also important as we debated very comprehensively and in my opinion very well in this house some time ago to pay attention to areas with specific geographical circumstances and naturally to consider the matter of demographic change in europe which is something that we will encounter very often and need to deal with

in nineteen ninety five gabon approached the european union as did madagascar about concluding an agreement on tuna
looking at the progress made i can assert that the commission has absolutely no regrets about having set itself the objective of achieving a positive declaration of assurance concerning the underlying transactions
those debates are more open and regional conflicts less frequent
this is a demonstration of european diversity and of the need to be sensitive to the realities faced by others
however we regret that other amendments have not been adopted firstly because of the heavy dependence of primary agricultural production on external factors we proposed including a clause dealing with this specific characteristic and spending the directives application to agricultural products in the case of damage resulting from natural disasters or other cases of force mature

i respect those members who have doubts who see the risks rather than the hopes but i do not accept that we should use the essential defence of human dignity as a sort of bludgeon to silence those who do not wish to reduce the whole of human dignity to a collection of cells where would that leave the dignity of those who suffer a thousand deaths before actually dying or those who are sunk in the depths of disease or dementia

thirdly the members of the committees on foreign affairs and on development because they have approved this report unanimously by means of a very unusual vote ― fifty one votes in favour zero votes against and zero abstentions and with no amendment to plenary on behalf of the political groups ― which demonstrates clearly the will of the whole of parliament to back the report that will be put to the vote tomorrow
the debate also clearly showed that the issue of minorities is very complex and as i said before it must primarily be dealt with by the member states although there is also a role for the european union and the european commission therefore i am pleased to be able to say ladies and gentlemen that as early as june we will submit a conceptual document to the council that will attempt to review our hitherto ineffective policies
this time of global problems should of course be a time when the eu comes into its own because we have a multinational reach but as liberals and democrats we would say ok let us use that reach but it should not reach too far

we must correct this in the following way firstly the regions must be consulted at every stage of the legislative procedure in the european union secondly we must urge the member states to allow them the greatest possible participation throughout the european decisionmaking process in each of the states including at the level of representation within the council of ministers we must also increase the role of the committee of the regions and allow the regions to be able to act within the framework of the principle of subsidiary
that is the background to the position i adopted
i am referring to the extremely high import duties imposed by south korea on canned fruit
it will be very difficult for the eu to offer applicant countries the same agricultural support which spain portugal and greece could rely on receiving as they approached membership it is not at all likely that an unreformed common agricultural policy would be to the advantage of the eastern european countries in question
we cannot allow ourselves to become notorious for during citizens in this way
in addition i consider it necessary to proceed with the implementation of programmes to educate the population in prevention and early diagnosis of diseases and lastly i would emphasis the primary role that the authorities on the ground must play to this end
with regard to procedural rights we have focused strongly on people who get into trouble because they may have committed a crime we have been concerned to see that their rights are looked after as we should be in our rightsbased society
that will be the outcome of these clinical trials
madam commissioner i did not understand all the technical details you mentioned but i imagine your services will know more about them than we do
it groups them together and that is very important
madam president commissioner mr presidentin office of the council ladies and gentlemen i would like to emphasis certain points that have already been raised
there are many deficiencies in it and much of the criticism comes from the fact that it is still very ambitious and it is difficult to implement
why should we predefine the issues on which citizens can raise an initiative
information must also be drawn up that is directed particularly at vulnerable groups and we have a requirement that infringements of the rules must be published
a committee meeting may be held even on thursday but without taking a vote this is what we have decided
i would also like to thank the european parliament and its committee on petitions for their good advice and support
as a result there is a growing wave of indignation among millions of workers women young people victims of salary cuts and precarious poorly paid work the unemployed and retired people with pitiful pensions
to achieve a comprehensive highquality agreement that goes beyond the w t o commitments neither party should express requirements that conflict with their internal policies or institutional arrangements

on the specifics of the resolution the e p l p obtained on paragraph five which calls for the emu countries to be represented by a single voice on international bodies
each of these states has its own problems with ethnic groups or minorities just as each member state of the european union does without exception
the other option is for us to harmonies the field of application and use so that we do not fall back to the national level in this regard and only have european harmonization in relation to the products themselves and not in relation to their use
first of all the word may is occasionally replaced by must
the british delegation of labour m e p s welcomes the action taken by n a t o member states to investigate the causes of deaths and illnesses suffered by troops who served in the balkans
subject freedom of religion in china
lastly in conclusion i would like to remind you that as with the fires in greece in two thousand and seven this violent storm has demonstrated the need for a civil protection force that can be mobilized in all crisis areas
but let us keep the policy as it is
a first opportunity will be the summit on the seventeenth of may and the meeting with president putin
i therefore obtained during the final vote
i should also like to ask simply that we should also give political rights to those whom we welcome for their work
we also adopted a number of related documents most noteworthy being the report on the implementation of the broad economic policy guidelines and the general principles of a new european employment strategy
the success in establishing the natura two thousand network has so far been very limited
freedom of the press is indeed an important right but why have you kept quiet for the last twenty years when it was obvious that in the former socialist countries the media was concentrated to a very large extent in the hands of the former communist parties all i ask of you is not to employ double standards
the european neighbourhood and partnership instrument is a special instrument which builds on m e d a as regards programming and implementation
since the amendment i have mentioned was voted on in block voting with many other amendments we were not able to vote against it but we would like it placed on the record that we are not in agreement with its content
many members have said this already this afternoon all the opinion polls in all the european countries point to one thing it is not the french government not the german government and not the belgian government that have become isolated instead it is tony blair josé maría aznar and silvio berlusconi that have lost touch with european reality
with your usual vehemence you are concealing your own failure because i would remind you that you denounced your own resolution of two thousand and one which was in favour of a framework directive and in january you were forced to accept the fact that we were reiterating our demand for a legislative act by means of the decision procedure
i heard this most recently here in plenary today
this is a responsibility that i cannot and do not wish to assume
it is small wonder that staff morale in the commission is at a low ebb
of the council of europe is quite right to say that it is a fundamental duty incumbent on governments to actively investigate all human rights violations that are committed on their territory or against their citizens
do you think commissioner that a strong institution merging the regulatory authorities such as for example as in holland where the competition authority has taken over the energy regulatory authority and the telecommunications authority would be a good model for other member states as well
i think that this suggestion may be the balance between the two important issues of data protection and transparency
it is also desirable for friendly relationships to be established between these old european nations and ours
on behalf of the its group n l madam president the problem of immigration is an important one and is given far too little attention during debates on the euromediterranean partnership
and who decides whether a member state has taken due account of the other member state this is an unclear formulation and we would like it replaced
we will try to find the best ways to apply them
i do not belong to either group because i do in fact think that competition is an instrument a condition for achieving many other aims too
the new version of the directive includes selling off ports to the private sector together with the entire range of port services loading and unloading stevedoring and storage
the situation of human rights within the european union is by no means satisfactory and the annual report by amnesty international says as much
unfortunately we have few technologies available that use tunnel microscopy or selforganising phenomena
the commission must continue along these lines
as a result of this it is of particular concern that we make utilization of the best available techniques the rule rather than the exception the main strategy emerging as a result is to combat environmental pollution at source
there is just one item in the report about which i have reservations and here i am speaking on behalf of the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe so that i do not have to repeat myself in a moment and that is what we find under recital k which suggests that we demand that immigrants and tourists subordinate themselves to european tradition and heritage this is not a good piece of phrasing
it would withhold from member states a very useful additional means of combating organized crime without automatically demanding a rapid and satisfactory solution
amendment no fifteen is of a linguistic nature i have already indicated that i accept the principle of amendment no seventeen which contains a less extensive reference than amendment no eighteen to positive action and it can be accepted for the reasons i have already given
thank you mr vande lanotte
that also opens up the possibility for croatia to wrap up negotiations as early as this year as we have stated in our report
in my opinion our meeting today sent out a very clear message on georgia aimed at both georgia and also russia in terms of our capacity to respond to crisis situations and the unity of the european union
what a defeat for us all
n l why not make the council a second chamber in which case how would we better distinguish between the legislative and executive powers of the council
p t mr president vice president of the commission ladies and gentlemen i shall start with the report by mrs roure which i once again support in its efforts to reach a political agreement on the proposal for a framework decision on the protection of personal data in the framework of the third pillar that is not based on the lowest common denominator a minimum level of data protection and serious shortcomings
it is an excellent report because of course it condemns any kind of discrimination or racism against the roma and we like it because it promotes true integration by taking an admirable cultural approach
of course these studies always have a significant number of forecasts however they are fairly convincing if you think that they have taken account of all the prevailing conditions in each of the member states
and again in nineteen eighty seven and nineteen eighty nine the council and ministers drew conclusions and adopted a resolution which specifically dealt with combating failures at school
mr barros moura focuses on a key problem connected with the current stage of european integration which can only be described as lopsided market radicalism although we have a single european market a european currency and a european monetary policy we have no equivalent instruments of political union
taxpayers whom i represent across the united kingdoms capital – in barnet enfield croydon – are concerned that the tax they are paying which is channelled to the european commission is not being properly accounted for
however i feel that the crucial issues are different and i will list some of them firstly are the instruments we have used in recent years to regulate what are becoming increasingly marked imbalances still sufficiently update
what i suggest is that the bureau consider this matter and say whether it is actually standard practice for other meetings to be held during voting time
i do however want to highlight the economic importance of fishing which generates wealth and employment
the huge banana exporters like chiquita and del monte will gain hugely but african caribbean and pacific countries and small producers will be devastated
mr president ladies and gentlemen mr désir the commission has not yet received notification of the french law referred to earlier in the question raised by the member and the commission is therefore not ready to express a detailed opinion on the law
madam president in the opinion of my group although the rapporteurs resolution is indisputably satisfactory the council text is mediocre
mr president we did have a brief discussion about this when we voted during the last plenary session
it is the inhabitants of the area and nature that are going to suffer as a result
this is almost double the average unemployment rate
the new member states of the european union and the european union as a whole have a great deal to learn from the experience of those member states that have already adopted the single currency
it must be a parliament firmly anchored in the real world that is not vain enough to court stardom
i regard that as unacceptable
the second key question concerns possible financial corrections in the structural funds to which mr dankert made reference
el like my group i voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on structurally disadvantages regions
when travelling they rely on being able to obtain treatment at dialysis units other than those they normally use
as regards the european union houses i just want to say one thing parliament and the commission can be based in the same building or in neighboring buildings and that is a good approach
it is supplied to the most needy through european union n g o s the red cross and united nations organisations
pensions systems still reveal a lack of equality womens pensions are not as large as mens
the advocate general has clearly come out in favour of its being my and the committee on the environment s view that is correct and not that put forward by the commission
my thanks go out once more to the french presidency for their efforts on these matters and also to mrs wallis
it is a pity that they apparently failed to spot the relationships between the states in the area and iran and also the specific intentions of turkey in the region
therefore if we are genuinely interested in the competitiveness and good functioning of europes economy we have to proceed with this directive my group believes that it is in the longer interests of europes citizens
even mr fatuzzo the pensioners representative is well pleased
i would have like to have seen a specific disability directive that outlawed discrimination in access to goods and services and similarly one on age

yet this attempt to sacrifice freedom for the sake of stability left a continent divided and
this is the area of global inequality and the question of the whole global currency system in the future
p t i voted in favour of this report
in view of this situation it is hardly surprising that the market in poultry is in the grip of panic and threatened by disaster
these are not new jobs and this should not be what is behind european subsidy politics and for that reason i will obviously not approve the report before us
it is equally important to make sure that all interests that approach parliament have to register we cannot allow any loopholes which would let some interests go unregistered

i would ask the commission in each individual case to involve parliament at an earlier stage
they can simply stay in turkey or russia
the megaprogramme has been adopted by the governments without funds being made available and those funds have been taken away from development policy
we are talking about the life chances of millions of our fellow european citizens who have the right to the same opportunities as everyone else and our societies cannot afford to ignore the potential that lies in them
yet if the programmed right from the very name is indicative of this primary urge then that cannot be a good thing
various views were expressed during the debate
it is also ultimately a positive advertisement for europe that we are in a position to resolve such important issues even if the individual decisions are by no means easy
neither the commission nor parliament can be satisfied until that is the normal procedure
insofar as the second part of the amendment is concerned i can agree to the addition of a reference to the european parliament in the future regulation
this is nothing to reproach the december council with i evaluate it positively as i said at first but i do expect the commission to take up these ideas and be the dynamic factor for profound medium term reform of the common fisheries policy so that the desirable equilibrium can be achieved between responsible exploitation of resources and their conservation with equal opportunities for all the ships that form part of what ought to be a community fleet that is a european fleet
i deeply regret that the european council is unable to recognize that we are living in a rapidly aging society
the reasons behind this are not only electoral
once we can get the procedural legal point out of the way then let us discuss the technical measures but this has to be done on a proper sound legal basis
mr president given that in this house much has been said about the trade relations with china recently i would like to confine myself to one aspect namely counterfeiting and piracy
unfortunately neither amendment has been adopted to date

it only focuses on this aspect
i want to leap immediately to your defence because it was not merely rhetorical overstatement but above all did no service to the subject
only yesterday during the discussion on the our i requested that the issuing of the five hundred our banknote be postponed by one year because it could cause substantial difficulties for consumers within the new monetary system

it has economic problems which people are trying to resolve and good luck to them and we in the european union shall support the reforms
in principle however the p p e d e group is in favour of amendment
we are very proud that your report calls for enhanced cooperation between the european union and the council of europe in the field of minority rights on the basis of the copenhagen criteria the framework convention for the protection of national minorities and the european charter for regional or minority languages are after all key documents for both the european union and the european council
i cannot understand why he did not propose today one of the measures that the committee recommends namely the descending of the decision on gelatin it is not because of the commission that the decision has not been given practical effect but because the united kingdom government has not requested an export license and i point that out in order to acquaint this house with the true facts
the commission has done its homework very well let us all take the b s e crisis as a warning for the future

progress over european integration with serbia continues to be a challenge and it is conditional upon full cooperation with the relevant international tribunal including the arrest and hangover of the remaining accused the presidency is working hard for the provisional agreement on trade and commercial matters to be applied from the eu side as well for the ratification process of the stabilisation and association agreement signed last year to begin
mr president i now want to mention a number of factors which i consider important
it is an extremely reasonable proposal which is not intended to distort the initial position

at the very outset i would like to draw your attention to the significance of line gambling in todays world
these matters were discussed by parliament in the spring of this year
i have been involved in three intergovernmental conferences myself as a civil servant my view on intergovernmental conferences is that for the past twenty five years we have either been preparing negotiating or gratifying a new treaty
there is no doubt that the political dialogue commissioner vassiliou started as soon as she took office helped establish a sound basis for negotiation and the council welcomes that
it is true that measures such as the golden rule implemented in the united kingdom are useful insofar as public investment can logically be financed thorough debt or deficit
five per cent is not significant
it is a problem where we have deforestation and that is something that we could do something about
is it willing to allow a compensation system
i would call upon you to use your good offices to inform the council of fisheries ministers who are meeting in brussels this morning that it should respect the opinion of this house and should not ignore this recommendation which was made as a result of a very clear vote
if we use it properly if we actually use it as an instrument then it can produce reasonable results
only a dignified serbia can be a reliable partner for a historic reconciliation in the balkans and a historic reunification within the european union mr kacins report makes a remarkable contribution in that direction
it is preferable to make this investment sooner rather than later as delay could prove costly
the government of sudan however does not get off scotfree either
stop vattenfalls legal proceedings they are constructing our work on climate change
you will recall that the statement refers mainly to the creation of a fast and effective warning system against paedophiles
we do not know either exactly how to proceed
it is important to create a better mutual understanding with third countries and in these times of great upheaval to the south of our borders i believe it makes a lot of sense to answer these questions
at the same time we need to go further in eliminating export subsidies and much further in responding to a c p and l d c concerns in particular
f r i understand mrs gill s concern and i share her feeling that the third framework programme should no longer be impaling on the budget at this stage
in sweden we already had legislation and belgium has introduced legislation but otherwise nothing very much has happened
i agree that there has recently been an effort to inspect and monitor products and it is essential that this inspection and monitoring effort continues
furthermore mr alvaro as sarah ludford and mr coelho also mentioned we urgently need the framework decision and this is a matter which we want to put to the council
in many ways accessibility has also increased due to the larger number of premises serving alcoholic drinks above all however it is illegal sales of spirits beer and wine which have increased at the expense of swedish jobs tax revenue and supervision
are you satisfied with this rate of progress
only in the past six months under greek presidency did it seem possible to agree on a compromise text however it became a compromise that left something to be desired

as the commission has proposed we must give this strategy a new start by concentrating our action on achieving stronger and more sustainable growth and on creating more betterquality jobs

this is certainly a good and correct way of working and in general i feel this is the way things are being done
in this area we want to see electronic transactions and supplies made officially exempt from duty in the long term
well it does not often happen that a head of government admits that he has such great faith in his closest colleagues that he has to have them bugged so that they do not surrender to the temptation of corruption or collaboration with organised crime
it is not a question of pride it is a question of respect for the diversity of european languages of which danish is one
the parliamentary group which is following this problem closely and tabling and gaining approval for various amendments has highlights the issue of religious freedom we are concerned about the communist appointing of bishops it is like the vatican appointing generals in the chinese army it is incomprehensible and the freedom of so many chinese citizens is being violated
if that is so then the citizens of states should be given a real chance to have the last word in the debate on its ratification if at all possible by means of referendums
these allegations are completely unfounded
there are measures to be taken in all sectors including action on emissions from energy use and forest depletion
we need to be aware of these issues
adoption of an additional protocol to the international convention on the rights of the child banning military recruitment of children under eighteen would be one important stage
first we introduced a requirement for certification of every single consignment arriving in the european union

madam president i have no confidence in presidentdesignate romano prodi because he has justified n a t o s war by calling it necessary
in writing s v i do not want an internal market for weapons
without nine it also gives this bureau license to spend the reserve on the purchase of buildings in strasbourg
i believe that such exclusion would be counterproductive as it would lead to the multilateral definition of a comprehensive list of services considered to be of public interest and would open a multilateral debate on the desirable content of this list a subject on which each member state of the w t o might have a different view
as for the language arrangements as mentioned in this house we do not feel it is right to provide for the use of only a limited number of languages this goes against the principle of nondiscrimination between companies and creates a genuine directory of main languages
mr president i should to like to thank the commissioner
the postal service is also the social service
i commend these proposals to you because they result from intensive consultation with over one hundred businesses trade unions n g o s and academics to whom i offer my thanks and from whom i have seen the growing consensus for systematic dialogue and agreement between companies and all those who their business affects
it is important to stress that the longer effectiveness of activities financed by microcredit instruments and the possibility of fully achieving social integration largely depend on simultaneous guidance entering and training programmes which must accompany microfinance
it is being evaluated fortunately before we move on to save i i
i therefore welcome the fact that together in the european parliament we adopted the report on the treaty of lisbon
it is too soon to do so today i cannot answer this question today because the relevant decisions have not yet been taken
there is an urgent need to push through all the initiatives which aim to achieve better coordination of the minor details of the legislative processes which are then played out on a large scale in europe
yet the situation remains extremely tense not least because fatos nanos government which has gained strength again is threatening president sali berisha with arrest and proceedings for high treason which is punishable by death
i do not think it right that this situation should come about
mr president first of all i would like to express my appreciation for the fact that the garosci report keeps to the subject it deals with the pointofsale control systems
this measure seeks to control illegal immigration by repressive means such as repatriation
it is the shareholders who should pay and not the workers
this broadly positive assessment needs to be balanced with the recognition that four member states germany france italy and portugal still have large deficits that do not meet the requirements of the stability and growth pact
so i hope the conservatives will realize that and that iran is best served by allowing people greater participation in the government of their own country
i support mr papanikolaous report on an eu strategy for youth investing and empowering
they are important for every consumer
there are grounds for doing this however there is also a very major issue that is not resolved anywhere in this report namely the fact that we are eating more and more meat

i would merely say that the festive issue which mr dimitrakopoulos has raised is an extremely important one
has it considered the likely cost of the new nets and what measures might be put in place to aid the fleets transition to new mesh sizes
it is not enough to preserve and consolidate this model it should also be adapted to the needs of today and the anticipated needs of tomorrow
i am convinced that if we combine our efforts we will once again be able to show what the european union can do to improve the health of european women
it is a good basis for further work transparency and democracy are most important in the standardsetting process as is improved participation on the part of the weaker societal stakeholders consumers and environmental organizations
the members states must do their utmost to ensure that european maritime policy makes an important contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions
i was a member of the committee on budgets and of the conference of presidents when the majority decided that the secretariat should be in luxembourg and the meetings held by turns in strasbourg and brussels
today we can be in no doubt that it is mr milosevic who must bear the principal responsibility for what is happening which is not individual cases of infringements of human rights but crimes against humanity
one of them is rasja who would like to move to spain with her children
situation of people with disabilities
we should like to make it clear in this house that legally and financially that is possible
and lastly mrs president i believe that the only way to resolve all of this is to arrange a serious meeting between the s e r s the parliament and the french government
i have put this to the test and picked a random location in europe which is the base of a prominent member of the commission namely athens to examine the bathing water quality there
we must point out that we made a mistake in committee which for once might mean us spoiling a good idea from the council
if your approach were correct mr aznar we would have to concluded that you are appearing here today as a president of a foreign institution
a brief word on the proposed amendments
it is not in the interests of european citizens or in the interests of the european union as whole
no explicit sexual demands are made at first
i am very sorry that the minister is not in the chamber but my political group welcomes and supports the european unions new climate and energy package and the regulations it contains regarding the sharing of efforts among the member states
mr president i am pleased we are now one step closer to achieving noise restriction in europe
in recent days we have been giving mr c f s p some thought
the eus consolidated enlargement agenda covers the western balkans and turkey
british labour m e p s are pleased to have voted in favour of this resolution which marks a genuine effort on all sides to build consensus within this european parliament around the very difficult issue of iraq
here i believe lies the principal reason for not taking new decisions on spending at the european level together with the broadly general belief that the most important decisions for fighting unemployment have to be taken at the national level on the basis of employment policy guidelines already well defined at community level which the member states are encouraged to implement
the content and organization of studies remain within the remit of the individual states which is why their role and that of the universities themselves is so great
if the european commissioners are the result of a majority in each country our main concern should be that the commission president is faithful to what the european people have voted for in the european elections hence the importance and correctness of mr barroso becoming commission president
i do not believe that parliament should connive at the passing of laws which are little more than the selfindulgent aspirations of environment ministers
the defence of pluralism and diversity has always been one of the core values that have influenced the european union
i am not going to repeat the figures for growth or inflation or the extent to which monetary policy has contributed to growth or to the convergence of our economies nor the role played by the our as a protective factor in the face of external crises
that does however mean that you must not distort the market in achieving those targets
in order to combat all of this we need a european strategy
in the case of slovakia in the case of slovenia in the case of the baltic states which failed to apply human rights or had other problems the integration process including funding stopped until they came into line
the first steps here could be to introduce a european youth guarantee which would give young people a foothold in the labour market
we are sure that this programmed will develop an impetus of its own and by its new approach to bringing young people closer to europe and through its results it will show that mrs cressons intentions which she shares with parliament will be translated smoothly into action
so we need harmonization in the technical field too
opening up the sector to competition in this way and also opening up members states rail networks infrastructure within a short timescale could be detrimental to the development of europes railways in particular the process would introduce instability and uncertainty into a market that requires technological solutions and a high level of longer investment
perhaps the commission believes that it should own them on behalf of the people
we need a vision of a market economy the fundamental principle of the social market economy is already laid down in the treaty of lisbon
like others i believe this to be a basis and not an end
this demonstrates the pressing need to allow the development of supplementary selffunded high return pension schemes in the european union to usefully supplement state contributory pension schemes
there are also limited possibilities for an appeal
it begs the question of why the proposal has not been produced
i have made it to the best of my knowledge and belief and i repeat before parliament my personal commitment in the coming months to avoiding a repeat of such tragedies
we need to make sure that we have the policies to operate a fully comprehensive canvas on which all of these developments can take place
there are many ways we can tackle this problem

i hope member states will stand firm and support a total ban but they should also be realistic and accommodating
i believe that the proposed system of codification drafted using a data processing system is more efficient
i believe we should be more militant
when it comes to people who grow old because god has given them the genes to do so let us please beware of speaking in terms of the onset of european senility
